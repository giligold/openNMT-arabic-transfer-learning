In all there were only 18 minutes of footage shot in Gaza.
The journalists asked to speak to the cameraman, who was in Paris at the time, but France 2 told them he did not speak French and that his English was not good enough.
"The first 23 minutes of the footage showed Palestinians playing at war for the cameras, they said, falling down as if wounded, then getting up and walking away.
He wrote that he had said the bullets were fired by the Israelis because he trusted the cameraman, who had worked for France 2 since 1988.
"The image corresponded to the reality of the situation," he wrote, "not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank.
He said that, from 29 September to late October 2000, 118 Palestinians were killed, including 33 under the age of 18, compared to 11 adult Israelis killed during the same period.
===Esther Schapira documentaries=======2002: "Drei Kugeln und ein totes Kind"====In March 2002, the German network ARD broadcast "Drei Kugeln und ein totes Kind" ("Three Bullets and a Dead child") by Esther Schapira.
He said he fed six minutes back to Jerusalem, which he described as "from the shooting to the end.
One of them said they knew something was about to happen because of the number of camera crews that had gathered; Schapira said that at least 10 Palestinian photographers and camera crews working for Western news agencies had assembled at the junction.
One of the soldiers said the live fire started from the high-rise Palestinian blocks known as "the twins"—see the lower right quadrant of this image.
In the view of the soldier, the shooting was no accident, because the range was too close and the visibility too good, but the fire did not come from the Israeli position, he said.
He said Schapira had not succeeded in ruling out that the IDF had killed the boy, but had shown that it was impossible to say with certainty that they did.
Hospital records show that, at midday, a young boy was examined in the pathology department.
That evening, before dusk, the funeral took place in the al-Bureij refugee camp, about one hour away by car.
"The assumption that the boy in the footage was also the boy in the hospital morgue may not have been correct, Schapira suggested.
Schapira also argued that there was no blood in the France 2 footage, except for one red mark that she said was a red piece of cloth.
There were no blood stains by the concrete drum in some of the footage taken the next day, and in the images that show blood stains, she argued that the color of the blood was too bright given the time that had elapsed.
===Allegations about father's injuries===On December 13, 2007, Israel's Channel 10 aired an interview with Dr. Yehuda David, a physician at Tel Hashomer hospital near Tel Aviv.
David said the scars Jamal presented as bullet wounds from the 2000 incident were actually scars from a tendon repair operation that David performed in 1994.
David made the same assertions in an interview with a "Daniel Vavinsky," published in "Actualité Juive" (Jewish News) on September 4, 2008.
The French court ruled that there was not enough information to determine the cause of al-Durrah's wounds.
The ruling only determined that the publication was not considered libel under French law.
This purposeful choice presented the verdict as a victory to Israeli public diplomacy and as proof that Palestinians are using false propaganda in order to delegitimize Israel.
Even further, some of the media outlets presented the verdict as proof that the IDF could not be held responsible for Mohammad's death.
The case began on September 14, 2006.
We presented a DVD that was made in front of a bailiff from the original tape... not from the various copies you can find here and there.
The court heard that the boy put his hand to his forehead and moved his leg after the cameraman had said he was dead, and that there was no blood on the boy's shirt.
Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying, though the cameraman himself told National Public Radio on October 1, 2000 that he had said out loud, "the boy got killed," when he saw Muhammad lying in his father's lap.
This position did not appear in the cameraman's report; see the image on the left above.
" He said there was no evidence that the boy was wounded in his right leg or abdomen, as reported, and that if the injuries were genuine, they did not occur at the time of the televised events.
Had the shots come from the Israeli position, he wrote, only the lower limbs could have been hit.
There were calls for a public inquiry from historian Élie Barnavi, a former Israeli ambassador to France, and Richard Prasquier, president of the Council of Jewish Organisations in France.
Arab countries issued postage stamps bearing the images, parks and streets were named in Muhammad's honor, and Osama bin Laden mentioned Muhammad in a "warning" to President George Bush after 9/11.
Like other battle images, the authenticity of the footage was questioned precisely because it was so potent.

A documentary about the operation was broadcast soon after.
It has been estimated that the solid earth as a whole contains 730 ppm of carbon, with 2000 ppm in the core and 120 ppm in the combined mantle and crust.
In combination with oxygen in carbon dioxide, carbon is found in the Earth's atmosphere (approximately 810 gigatonnes of carbon) and dissolved in all water bodies (approximately 36,000 gigatonnes of carbon).
She died in 1930 at the age of 40 of a heroin overdose.
The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface.
It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, by Antarctica).
As one component of the World Ocean, the Indian Ocean is delineated from the Atlantic Ocean by the 20° east meridian running south from Cape Agulhas, and from the Pacific Ocean by the meridian of 146°55' east.
The northernmost extent of the Indian Ocean is approximately 30° north in the Persian Gulf.
North of 50° south latitude, 86% of the main basin is covered by pelagic sediments, of which more than half is globigerina ooze.
The remaining 14% is layered with terrigenous sediments.
===Climate===The climate north of the equator is affected by a monsoon climate.
Strong north-east winds blow from October until April; from May until October south and west winds prevail.
In the Arabian Sea the violent Monsoon brings rain to the Indian subcontinent.
In the southern hemisphere, the winds are generally milder, but summer storms near Mauritius can be severe.
During the winter monsoon, however, currents in the north are reversed.
Deep water circulation is controlled primarily by inflows from the Atlantic Ocean, the Red Sea, and Antarctic currents.
Surface water salinity ranges from 32 to 37 parts per 1000, the highest occurring in the Arabian Sea and in a belt between southern Africa and south-western Australia.
The Mascarene Plateau is 2000 km long undersea plateau that lies east of Madagascar.
It carries a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and petroleum products from the oil fields of the Persian Gulf and Indonesia.
They dominated trade and discovery along the coasts of Africa, and Asia until the mid 17th century.
Spain established a major trading operation in the Philippines and the Pacific.
By 1815, Britain became the principal power in the Indian Ocean.
Since World War II the United Kingdom was forced to withdraw from the area, to be replaced by India, the USSR, and the United States.
On 26 December 2004, the countries surrounding the Indian Ocean were hit by a tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.
The waves resulted in more than 226,000 deaths and over 1 million people were left homeless.
==Culture and literature==The Indian Ocean is known as Ratnakara in the ancient Sanskrit literature.

The study took place in Tuskegee, Alabama, and was supported by the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) in partnership with the Tuskegee Institute.
He spent the remainder of his life writing books and articles, mostly on the Middle East and on his experiences with the Arabs.
Epoxides are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms.

Sweden ( ; ), officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.
At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of about 9.7 million.
The empire grew to be one of the great powers of Europe in the 17th and early 18th centuries.
The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814, when Sweden by military means forced Norway into a personal union.
The Suehans were the suppliers of black fox skins for the Roman market.
What happened to the crew is unknown, but it is believed that they died of sickness.
;The Kingdom of SwedenIt is not known when and how the kingdom of Sweden was born, but the list of Swedish monarchs is drawn from the first kings known to have ruled both Svealand (Sweden) and Götaland (Gothia) as one province, beginning with Eric the Victorious.
Between 800 and 1000, trade brought an abundance of silver to Gotland, and according to some scholars, the Gotlanders of this era hoarded more silver than the rest of the population of Scandinavia combined.
St. Ansgar is usually credited with introducing Christianity in 829, but the new religion did not begin to fully replace paganism until the 12th century.
During the 11th century, Christianity became the most prevalent religion, and from 1050 Sweden is counted as a Christian nation.
Swedish kings began to expand the Swedish-controlled territory in Finland, creating conflicts with the Rus who no longer had any connection with Sweden.
Still, Sweden remained a poor and economically backward country in which barter was the means of exchange.
;The Plague in SwedenIn the middle of 14th century, Sweden was struck by the Black Death.
In 1319, Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus Eriksson, and in 1397 Queen Margaret I of Denmark effected the personal union of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark through the Kalmar Union.
During the Thirty Years' War, Sweden conquered approximately half of the Holy Roman states.
In the middle of the 17th century Sweden was the third-largest country in Europe by land area, only surpassed by Russia and Spain.
The foundation of Sweden's success during this period is credited to Gustav I's major changes on the Swedish economy in the 16th century, and his introduction of Protestantism.
After more than half a century of almost constant warfare, the Swedish economy had deteriorated.
Sweden's largest threat at this time, Russia, had a larger army but was far behind in both equipment and training.
After the success of invading Poland, Charles decided to make an attempt at invading Russia, but this ended in a decisive Russian victory at the Battle of Poltava in 1709.
With Sweden's lost influence, Russia emerged as an empire and became one of Europe's dominant nations.
As the war finally ended in 1721, Sweden had lost an estimated 200,000 men, 150,000 of those from the area of present-day Sweden and 50,000 from the Finnish part of Sweden.
In the 18th century, Sweden did not have enough resources to maintain its territories outside Scandinavia, and most of them were lost, culminating with the loss in 1809 of eastern Sweden to Russia, which became the highly autonomous Grand Principality of Finland in Imperial Russia.
He launched a military campaign against Norway on 27 July 1814, ending in the Convention of Moss, which forced Norway into a personal union with Sweden under the Swedish crown, which lasted until 1905.
The 1814 campaign was the last time Sweden was at war.
Between 1750 and 1850, the population in Sweden doubled.
In the early 20th century, more Swedes lived in Chicago than in Gothenburg (Sweden's second largest city).
Because the Swedish peasantry had never been enserfed as elsewhere in Europe, the Swedish farming culture began to take on a critical role in Swedish politics, which has continued through modern times with modern Agrarian party (now called the Centre Party).
Strong grassroots movements sprung up in Sweden during the latter half of the 19th century (trade unions, temperance groups, and independent religious groups), creating a strong foundation of democratic principles.
In 1889 The Swedish Social Democratic Party was founded.
===World War II===As in the first world war, Sweden remained officially neutral during World War II, although its neutrality during World War II has been disputed.
Sweden was under German influence for much of the war, as ties to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades.
The Swedish government felt that it was in no position to openly contest Germany, and therefore made some concessions.
Between 1970 and 1990 the overall tax burden rose by over 10%, and the growth was low compared to other countries in Western Europe.

About 15% of Sweden lies north of the Arctic Circle.
Vänern is the third largest in Europe, after Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega in Russia.
However, Sweden is much warmer and drier than other places at a similar latitude, and even somewhat farther south, mainly because of the Gulf Stream.
For example, central and southern Sweden has much warmer winters than many parts of Russia, Canada, and the northern United States.
North of the Arctic Circle, the sun never sets for part of each summer, and it never rises for part of each winter.
In the capital, Stockholm, daylight lasts for more than 18 hours in late June but only around 6 hours in late December.

Before a case can be decided by the Supreme Court, leave to appeal must be obtained, and with few exceptions, leave to appeal can be granted only when the case is of interest as a precedent.
The Supreme Court consists of 16 Justices (), appointed by the Government, but the court as an institution is independent of the Riksdag, and the Government is not able to interfere with the decisions of the court.
Sweden's doctrine of neutrality is often traced back to the 19th century as the country has not been in a state of war since the end of the Swedish campaign against Norway in 1814.
During World War II Sweden joined neither the allied nor axis powers.
At the same time, the country maintained relatively close informal connections with the Western bloc, especially in the realm of intelligence exchange.
Later investigations revealed that the plane was actually gathering information for NATO.
Beginning in the late 1960s, Sweden attempted to play a more significant and independent role in international relations.
It involved itself significantly in international peace efforts, especially through the United Nations, and in support to the Third World.
The incident triggered a diplomatic crisis between Sweden and the Soviet Union.
Since 1995 Sweden has been a member of the European Union, and as a consequence of a new world security situation the country's foreign policy doctrine has been partly modified, with Sweden playing a more active role in European security co-operation.
The primary task of the agency is to train and deploy peace support forces abroad, while maintaining the long-term ability to refocus on the defence of Sweden in the event of war.
The armed forces are divided into Army, Air Force and Navy.
Until the end of the Cold War, nearly all males reaching the age of military service were conscripted.
All soldiers serving abroad must by law be volunteers.
In 1975 the total number of conscripts was 45,000.
By 2003 it was down to 15,000.
The total forces gathered would consist of about 60,000 men.
This could be compared with the 1980s before the fall of the Soviet Union, when Sweden could gather up to 1,000,000 men.
GDP per-hour-worked is growing 2.5% per year for the economy as a whole and the trade-terms-balanced productivity growth is 2%.

Tax income-financed employment represents a third of the Swedish workforce, a substantially higher proportion than in most other countries.
According to the book "The Flight of the Creative Class" by the US economist Professor Richard Florida of the University of Toronto, Sweden is ranked as having the best creativity in Europe for business and is predicted to become a talent magnet for the world's most purposeful workers.
In 2006, out of a total electricity production of 139 TWh, electricity from hydropower accounted for 61 TWh (44%), and nuclear power delivered 65 TWh (47%).
The 1973 oil crisis strengthened Sweden's commitment to decrease dependence on imported fossil fuels.
The use of nuclear power has been limited, however.
Among other things, the accident of Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station (United States) prompted the Riksdag to ban new nuclear plants.
In March 2005, an opinion poll showed that 83% supported maintaining or increasing nuclear power.
Politicians have made announcements about oil phase-out in Sweden, decrease of nuclear power, and multi-billion dollar investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency.
The country has for many years pursued a strategy of indirect taxation as an instrument of environmental policy, including energy taxes in general and carbon dioxide taxes in particular.
The system of motorways is still under construction and a new motorway from Uppsala to Gävle was finished on 17 October 2007.
Sweden had left-hand traffic (Vänstertrafik in Swedish) from approximately 1736 and continued to do so well into the 20th century.
The largest airports include Stockholm–Arlanda Airport (16.1 million passengers in 2009) north of Stockholm, Göteborg–Landvetter Airport (4.3 million passengers in 2008), and Stockholm–Skavsta Airport (2.0 million passengers).
From the mid-1990s until today Sweden's economic growth has once again accelerated and has been higher than in most other industrialised countries (including the US) during the last 15 years.
Since the 1930s, the agricultural sector had been subject to price controls.
As a result, food prices fell somewhat.
Since the late 1960s, Sweden has had the highest tax quota (as percentage of GDP) in the industrialised world, although today the gap has narrowed and Denmark has surpassed Sweden as the most heavily taxed country among developed countries.
Public sector spending amounts to 53% of the GDP.
State and municipal employees total around a third of the workforce, much more than in most Western countries.
Only Denmark has a larger public sector (38% of Danish workforce).
Sweden has a relatively high amount of sick leave per worker in OECD: the average worker loses 24 days due to sickness.
In December 2008, the number employed in the 16–64 age group was 75.0%.
The employment tendency was very strong in 2007.
The positive trend continued during the first half of 2008, but the rate of increase slackened.
Lars Magnus Ericsson started the company bearing his name, Ericsson, still one of the largest telecom companies in the world.
As a nation, only ten other countries hold more patents than Sweden.
The population density is 20.6 people per km² (53.3 per square mile) and it is substantially higher in the south than in the north.
About 85% of the population live in urban areas.
Between 1820 and 1930, approximately 1.3 million Swedes, a third of the country's population, emigrated to North America, and most of them to the United States.
There are more than 4.4 million Swedish Americans according to a 2006 US Census Bureau estimate.
In Canada, the community of Swedish ancestry is 330,000 strong.
Swedish became Sweden's official language on 1 July 2009, when a new language law was implemented.
In a 2005 survey by Eurobarometer, 89% of Swedes reported the ability to speak English.
Depending on the local school authorities, English is currently a compulsory subject between first grade and ninth grade, with all students continuing in secondary school studying English for at least another year.
Most students also study one and sometimes two additional languages.
Some Danish and Norwegian is at times also taught as part of Swedish courses for native speakers.
In 2000 the Church of Sweden was separated from the state and Sweden ceased to have any official church.
The reason for the large number of inactive members is partly that, until 1996, children automatically became members at birth if at least one of the parents was a member.
In a Eurostat survey, 23% of Swedish citizens responded that "they believe there is a God", whereas 53% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 23% that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force".
===Health===Healthcare in Sweden is similar in quality to other developed nations.
A person seeking care first contacts a clinic for a doctor's appointment, and may then be referred to a specialist by the clinic physician, who may in turn recommend either in-patient or out-patient treatment, or an elective care option.
The health care is governed by the 21 landsting of Sweden and is mainly funded by taxes, with nominal fees for patients.
At the present time, the number of single people is one of the highest in the world.
Sweden has also become very liberal towards homosexuality, as is reflected in the popular acceptance of films such as "Show Me Love", which is about two young lesbians in the small Swedish town of Åmål.
In fact, out of a population of 9.5 million, it is estimated that five to six hundred thousand people sing in choirs.
In 2007, with over 800 million dollars in revenue, Sweden was the third-largest music exporter in the world and surpassed only by the US and the UK.
ABBA was one of the first internationally well known popular music bands from Sweden, and still ranks among the most prominent bands in the world, with about 370 million records sold.
With ABBA, Sweden entered into a new era, in which Swedish pop music gained international prominence.
===Architecture===Before the 13th century almost all buildings were made of timber, but a shift began towards stone.
Early Swedish stone buildings are the Romanesque churches on the country side.
As so happens, many of them were built in Scania and are in effect Danish churches.
This would include the magnificent Lund Cathedral from the 11th century and the somewhat younger church in Dalby, but also many early Gothic churches built through influences of the Hanseatic League, such as in Ystad, Malmö and Helsingborg.
Cathedrals in other parts of Sweden were also built as seats of Sweden's bishops.
The Skara Cathedral is of bricks from the 14th century, and the Uppsala Cathedral in the 15th.
In 1230 the foundations of the Linköping Cathedral were made, the material was there limestone, but the building took some 250 years to finish.
Among older structures are also some significant fortresses and other historical buildings such as at Borgholm Castle, Halltorps Manor and Eketorp fortress on the island Öland, the Nyköping fortress and the Visby ring wall.
Some of the more magnificent include the Kalmar fortress, the Gripsholm Castle and the one at Vadstena.
In the next two centuries, Sweden was designated by Baroque architecture and later the rococo.
Notable projects from that time include the city Karlskrona, which has now also been declared a World Heritage Site and the Drottningholm Palace.
1930 was the year of the great Stockholm exhibition, which marked the breakthrough of Functionalism, or "funkis" as it became known.
The style came to dominate in the following decades.
===Media===Swedes are among the greatest consumers of newspapers in the world, and nearly every town is served by a local paper.
A second radio network was started in 1954 and a third opened 1962 in response to pirate radio stations.
A second channel, TV2, was launched in 1969.
The first Swedish language satellite service was TV3 which started broadcasting from London in 1987.
It was followed by Kanal 5 in 1989 (then known as Nordic Channel) and TV4 in 1990.
In 1991 the government announced it would begin taking applications from private television companies wishing to broadcast on the terrestrial network.
TV4, which had previously been broadcasting via satellite, was granted a permit and began its terrestrial broadcasts in 1992, becoming the first private channel to broadcast television content from within the country.
Therefore there are only a few texts in the Old Swedish from that period.
The early 20th century continued to produce notable authors, such as Selma Lagerlöf, (Nobel laureate 1909), Verner von Heidenstam (Nobel laureate 1916) and Pär Lagerkvist (Nobel laureate 1951).
6 June is the National Day of Sweden and has since 2005 been a public holiday.
These companies, however, are composed largely of buyers who import fashionable goods from throughout Europe and America, continuing the trend of Swedish business toward multinational economic dependency like many of its neighbours.
The Swedish national football team has seen some success at the World Cup in the past, finishing second when they hosted the tournament in 1958, and third twice, in 1950 and 1994.
It is situated on the northern coast of the country, on the shore of the Gulf of Finland, south of Helsinki, east of Stockholm and west of Saint Petersburg.
It is ranked as a global city and has been listed among the top 10 digital cities in the world.
The city was a European Capital of Culture for 2011, along with Turku in Finland.
It is the main source of the city's drinking water.
The highest point in Tallinn, at 64 meters above sea level, is situated in Hiiu, Nõmme District, in the south-west of the city.
At the winter solstice daylight only lasts for 6 hours.
The average humidity is 81%, ranging from a high of 88% to a low of 69% in May.
The city benefits from the high level of economic freedom, liberal economic policy and has a highly diversified economy with particular strengths in information technology, tourism and logistics.
Currently, over half of the Estonian GDP is created in Tallinn.
In 2008, the GDP per capita of Tallinn stood at 172% of the Estonian average.
In recent years Tallinn has gradually been becoming one of the main IT centre of Europe, with CCD COE of NATO, EU Agency for large-scale IT systems and IT development centres of large corporations, such as TeliaSonera and Kuehne + Nagel being based in the city.
The city also hosts the headquarters of Elering, a national electric power transmission system operator and member of ENTSO-E, the Estonian natural gas company Eesti Gaas and energy holding company Alexela Energia, part of Alexela Group.
Nord Pool Spot, the largest market for electrical energy in the world, established its local office in Tallinn.
The time allowed is actual playing time; the clock is stopped while the play is not active.
Good dribblers (or "ball handlers") tend to bounce the ball low to the ground, reducing the distance of travel of the ball from the floor to the hand, making it more difficult for the defender to "steal" the ball.
==History==Soon after publishing the special theory of relativity in 1905, Einstein started thinking about how to incorporate gravity into his new relativistic framework.
After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations.
The Einstein field equations are nonlinear and very difficult to solve.
This solution laid the groundwork for the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes.
During that period, general relativity remained something of a curiosity among physical theories.
George Walker Bush (born July 6, 1946) is an American politician and businessman who served as the 43rd President of the United States from 2001 to 2009, and the 46th Governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000.
====War on Terrorism====After September 11, Bush announced a global War on Terror.
Dissent and criticism of Bush's leadership in the War on Terror increased as the war in Iraq continued.
====Afghanistan invasion====On October 7, 2001, U.S. and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of Northern Alliance troops in Kabul on November 13.
The main goals of the war were to defeat the Taliban, drive al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders.
In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated, but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders.
On September 2, 2007, North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all of its nuclear programs by the end of 2007.
A victory over the Muslims at the Battle of Ourique in 1139 is traditionally taken as the occasion when the County of Portugal as a fief of the Kingdom of León was transformed into the independent Kingdom of Portugal.
On 24 June 1128, the Battle of São Mamede occurred near Guimarães.
In 1373, Portugal made an alliance with England, which is the longest-standing alliance in the world.
In 1415, Portugal acquired the first of its overseas colonies by conquering Ceuta, the first prosperous Islamic trade centre in North Africa.
There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic: Madeira and the Azores, which led to the first colonization movements.
In 1498, Vasco da Gama reached India and brought economic prosperity to Portugal and its population of 1.7 million residents, helping to start the Portuguese Renaissance.
In 1500, Pedro Álvares Cabral discovered Brazil and claimed it for Portugal.
Thus, the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic.
All these factors made Portugal the world's major economic, military, and political power from the 15th century until the late 16th century.
In 1762, Spain invaded Portuguese territory as part of the Seven Years' War, but by 1763 the "status quo" between Spain and Portugal before the war had been restored.
In the autumn of 1807, Napoleon moved French troops through Spain to invade Portugal.
However, the King of Portugal remained in Brazil until the Liberal Revolution of 1820, which started in Porto, demanded his return to Lisbon in 1821.
Thus he returned to Portugal but left his son Pedro in charge of Brazil.
When the Portuguese Government attempted the following year to return the Kingdom of Brazil to subordinate status, his son Pedro, with the overwhelming support of the Brazilian elites, declared Brazil's independence from Portugal.
This forced the Portuguese military to retreat from the land between the Portuguese colonies of Mozambique and Angola (most of present-day Zimbabwe and Zambia), which had been claimed by Portugal and included in its "Pink Map", which clashed with British aspirations to create a Cape to Cairo Railway.
Portugal was one of only five European countries to remain neutral in World War II.
The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the Indian subcontinent.
Also in the early 1960s, independence movements in the Portuguese overseas provinces of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea in Africa, resulted in the Portuguese Colonial War (1961–1974).
By 1975, all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held its first democratic elections in 50 years.
On 5 July 2004, José Manuel Barroso, then Prime Minister of Portugal, was nominated President of the European Commission, the most powerful office in the European Union.
On 1 December 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force, after it had been signed by the European Union member states on 13 December 2007 in the Jerónimos Monastery, in Lisbon, enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union and improving the coherence of its action.

Research about quality of life by the Economist Intelligence Unit's quality of life survey placed Portugal as the country with the 19th-best quality of life in the world for 2005, ahead of other economically and technologically advanced countries like France, Germany, the United Kingdom and South Korea, but 9 places behind its only neighbour, Spain.
The poor performance of the Portuguese economy was explored in April 2007 by The Economist, which described Portugal as "a new sick man of Europe".
From 2002 to 2007, the unemployment rate increased by 65% (270,500 unemployed citizens in 2002, 448,600 unemployed citizens in 2007).
A number of both national and multinational high-tech and industrial companies, are also responsible for research and development projects.
One of the oldest learned societies of Portugal is the Sciences Academy of Lisbon, founded in 1779.
Egas Moniz, a Portuguese physician who developed the cerebral angiography and leucotomy, received in 1949 the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine – he is the first Portuguese recipient of a Nobel Prize and the only in the sciences.
=== Education ===The educational system is divided into preschool (for those under age 6), basic education (9 years, in three stages, compulsory), secondary education (3 years, until 12th grade), and higher education (university and polytechnic).
Over 35% of college-age citizens (20 years old) attend one of the country's higher education institutions (compared with 50% in the United States and 35% in the OECD countries).
In addition to being a destination for international students, Portugal is also among the top places of origin for international students.
All higher education students, both domestic and international, totaled 380,937 in 2005.
Portuguese universities have existed since 1290.
The largest university in Portugal is the University of Lisbon.
Portuguese people die 12% less often from cancer than in the Eur-A, but mortality is not declining as rapidly as in the Eur-A.
Cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than 44 years.
Although lung cancer (slowly increasing among women) and breast cancer (decreasing rapidly) are scarcer, cancer of the cervix and the prostate are more frequent.
Portugal has the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the Eur-A, with a sharp increase since the 1980s.
Thus, survey results based on self-reporting at the household level complement other data on health status and the use of services.
Only one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal (Kasmel et al., 2004).
These include the Belém Cultural Centre in Lisbon, Serralves Foundation and the Casa da Música, both in Porto, as well as new public cultural facilities like municipal libraries and concert halls that were built or renovated in many municipalities across the country.
Out of the summer season, Portugal has a large number of festivals, designed more to an urban audience, like Flowfest or Hip Hop Porto.
There is also the student festivals of "Queima das Fitas" are major events in a number of cities across Portugal.
In equestrian sports, Portugal won the only Horseball-Pato World Championship (in 2006), achieved the third position in the First Horseball World Cup (organized in Ponte de Lima, Portugal, in 2008), and has achieved several victories in the European Working Equitation Championship.

During World War II, Azerbaijan played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of Soviet Union, with most of the Soviet Union's oil on the Eastern Front being supplied by Baku.
By the Decree of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in February 1942, the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the oil industry of Azerbaijan was awarded orders and medals.
On 18 October 1991, the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan adopted a Declaration of Independence which was affirmed by a nationwide referendum in December 1991, when the Soviet Union was officially dissolved.

==Economy==After gaining independence in 1991, Azerbaijan became a member of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Islamic Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
The banking system of Azerbaijan consists of the Central Bank of Azerbaijan, commercial banks and non-banking credit organizations.
The National (now Central) Bank was created in 1992 based on the Azerbaijan State Savings Bank, an affiliate of the former State Savings Bank of the USSR.
The Central Bank serves as Azerbaijan's central bank, empowered to issue the national currency, the Azerbaijani manat, and to supervise all commercial banks.
Azerbaijan shows some signs of the so-called "Dutch disease" because of the fast-growing energy sector, which causes inflation and makes non-energy exports more expensive.
At the beginning of 2007 there were 4,755,100 hectares of utilized agricultural area.
In the same year the total wood resources counted 136 million m³.
However, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the Nagorno-Karabakh War during the 1990s, damaged the tourist industry and the image of Azerbaijan as a tourist destination.
In 2002, the Azerbaijani government established the Ministry of Transport with a broad range of policy and regulatory functions.
In the same year, the country became a member of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic.
51% of the total population were female.

The government spends 4.9% of the country's GDP on the military, and one out of every four dollars of government spending is spent on defence.
This force was considered too small to provide effective security for the new country, so the development of the military became a priority.
Britain pulled its military out of Singapore in October 1971, leaving behind only a small British, Australian and New Zealand force as a token military presence.
The last British soldier left Singapore in March 1976.
New Zealand troops were the last to leave, in 1989.
A great deal of initial support came from Israel, a country that is not recognised by neighbouring Muslim-majority nations of Malaysia, Indonesia or Brunei.
The main fear after independence was an invasion by Malaysia.
Singapore still maintains strong security ties with Israel and is one of the biggest buyers of Israeli arms and weapons systems.
The MATADOR is one example of recent Singapore-Israeli collaboration.
The SAF is being developed to respond to a wide range of issues, in both conventional and unconventional warfare.
The geographic restrictions of Singapore mean that the SAF must plan to fully repulse an attack, as they can not fall back and re-group.
The small size of the population has also affected the way the SAF has been designed, with a small active force but a large number of reserves.
Singapore has conscription for all able-bodied males at age 18, except those with a criminal record or who can prove that their loss would bring hardship to their families.
Though not required to perform military service, the number of women in the SAF has been increasing: since 1989 they have been allowed to fill military vocations formerly reserved for men.
Before induction into a specific branch of the armed forces, recruits undergo at least 9 weeks of basic military training.
Because of the scarcity of open land on the main island, training involving activities such as live firing and amphibious warfare is often carried out on smaller islands, typically barred to civilian access.
This also avoids risk to the main island and the city.
Training is also held in about a dozen other countries.
In general, military exercises are held with foreign forces once or twice per week.
The RSAF also has a few overseas detachments in the United States, in San Diego, California, Marana, Arizona, Grand Prairie, Texas and Luke Air Force Base, among others.
The SAF has sent forces to assist in operations outside the country, in areas such as Iraq and Afghanistan, in both military and civilian roles.
In the region, it has helped stabilise East Timor and has provided aid to Aceh in Indonesia following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.
The SAF also helped in relief efforts during Hurricane Katrina.
Singapore is part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements, a military alliance with Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.
All institutions, private and public, must be registered with the Ministry of Education.
The curriculum is focused on the development of English, the mother tongue, mathematics, and science.
The basic coursework breakdown is the same as in the primary level, although classes are much more specialised.
Some schools have a degree of freedom in their curriculum and are known as autonomous schools.
These exist from the secondary education level and up.
National examinations are standardised across all schools, with a test taken after each stage.
After the first six years of education, students take the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), which determines their placement at secondary school.
At the end of the secondary stage, GCE "O"-Level exams are taken; at the end of the following pre-university stage, the GCE "A"-Level exams are taken.
=== Media ===Companies linked to the government control much of the domestic media in Singapore.
There are a total of seven free-to-air TV channels offered by Mediacorp.
The channels are Channel 5 (English channel), Channel News Asia (English channel), Okto (English channel), Channel 8 (Chinese channel), Channel U (Chinese channel), Suria (Malay channel) and Vasantham (Indian channel).
Singapore's media industry has sometimes been criticised for being too regulated and lacking in freedom by human rights groups such as Freedom House.
In 2010, Reporters Without Borders, a France-based international non-governmental organisation, ranked Singapore 136 out of 178 in its Press Freedom Index, just below Mexico.
There are 3.4 million users of the internet in Singapore, one of the highest internet penetration rates in the world.
As the block covers only home internet access, users may still visit the blocked websites from their office computers.
==Culture and society==The civil society in Pakistan is largely hierarchical, emphasising local cultural etiquettes and traditional Islamic values that govern personal and political life.
The basic family unit is the extended family, although there has been a growing trend towards nuclear families for socio-economic reasons.
The middle class has increased to around 35 million and the upper and upper-middle classes to around 17 million in recent decades, and power is shifting from rural landowners to the urbanised elites.
Pakistanis wear clothes range from exquisite colors and designs to the type of fabric (silk, chiffon, cotton, etc).

Pakistani media has also played a vital role in exposing corruption.
Furthermore, 50.0% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.
Immigration, both from within and outside the country, is regarded as one of the main factors that has contributed to urbanisation in Pakistan.
One analysis of the national census held in 1998 highlighted the significance of the Partition of India in the 1940s in the context of understanding urban change in Pakistan.
During the independence period, Muslim Muhajirs from India migrated in large numbers and shifted their domicile to Pakistan, especially to the port city of Karachi, which is today the largest metropolis in Pakistan.
Migration from other countries, mainly those in the neighbourhood, has further catalysed the process of urbanisation in Pakistani cities.
Of particular interest is migration that occurred in the aftermath of the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, in the form of stranded Biharis who were relocated to Pakistan.
The conflict in Afghanistan also forced millions of Afghan refugees into Pakistan, particularly in the northwestern regions.
The Overseas Pakistani Division (OPD) was created in September 2004 within the Ministry of Labour (MoL), and has since recognized the importance of overseas Pakistanis and their contribution to the nation's economy.
Together with Community Welfare Attaches (CWAs) and the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation (OPF), the OPD is improving the welfare of Pakistanis who reside abroad.
The division aims to provide better services through improved facilities at airports, and suitable schemes for housing, education and health care—its largest effort is the facilitation of the rehabilitation of returning overseas Pakistanis.
Before the 19th century , it consisted mainly of lyric and religious poetry, mystical and folkloric works.

With the beginning of the Indus civilisation around the middle of the 3rd millennium BCE, an advanced urban culture developed for the first time in the region, with large buildings, some of which survive to this day.
The rise of Buddhism and the Persian and Greek influence led to the development of the Greco-Buddhist style, starting from the 1st century CE.
The high point of this era was reached at the peak of the Gandhara style.
The arrival of Islam in today's Pakistan meant a sudden end of Buddhist architecture in the area and a smooth transition to the predominantly pictureless Islamic architecture.
Lahore, occasional residence of Mughal rulers, exhibits many important buildings from the empire.
In the British colonial period, predominantly functional buildings of the Indo-European representative style developed from a mixture of European and Indian-Islamic components.

The Philippines (; ), officially known as the Republic of the Philippines (), is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean.
Multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands.
In the 19th century, Philippine ports opened to world trade and shifts started occurring within Philippine society.
The ideals of revolution also began to spread through the islands.
Rizal was eventually executed on December 30, 1896, on charges of rebellion.
Bonifacio and the Katipunan started the Philippine Revolution in 1896.
In 1898, the Spanish–American War began in Cuba and reached the Philippines.

The longest river is the Cagayan River in northern Luzon.
The Benham Plateau to the east in the Philippine Sea is an undersea region active in tectonic subduction.
The last major earthquake was the 1990 Luzon earthquake.
There are many active volcanoes such as the Mayon Volcano, Mount Pinatubo, and Taal Volcano.
The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991 produced the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century.
Due to the volcanic nature of the islands, mineral deposits are abundant.
The country is estimated to have the second-largest gold deposits after South Africa and one of the largest copper deposits in the world.
Despite this, poor management, high population density, and environmental consciousness have resulted in these mineral resources remaining largely untapped.
It is one of the ten most biologically megadiverse countries and is at or near the top in terms of biodiversity per unit area.
Deforestation, often the result of illegal logging, is an acute problem in the Philippines.
Forest cover declined from 70% of the country's total land area in 1900 to about 18.3% in 1999.
According to Conservation International, "the country is one of the few nations that is, in its entirety, both a hotspot and a megadiversity country, placing it among the top priority hotspots for global conservation.
The southwest monsoon (from May to October) is known as the Habagat, and the dry winds of the northeast monsoon (from November to April), the Amihan.
In considering temperature, location in terms of latitude and longitude is not a significant factor.
Whether in the extreme north, south, east, or west of the country, temperatures at sea level tend to be in the same range.
Of the country's total labor force of around 40.813 Million, the agricultural sector employs close to 32% of the labor force, and accounts for 14% of GDP.
The industrial sector employs around 14% of the workforce and accounts for 30% of GDP.
Meanwhile the 47% of workers involved in the services sector are responsible for 56% of GDP.
The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis affected the economy, resulting in a lingering decline of the value of the peso and falls in the stock market.
This was largely due to the fiscal conservatism of the government, partly as a result of decades of monitoring and fiscal supervision from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in comparison to the massive spending of its neighbors on the rapid acceleration of economic growth.
There have been signs of progress since.
In 2004, the economy experienced 6.4% GDP growth and 7.1% in 2007, its fastest pace of growth in three decades.
Average annual GDP growth per capita for the period 1966–2007 still stands at 1.45% in comparison to an average of 5.96% for the East Asia and the Pacific region as a whole.
The population's median age is 22.7 years with 60.9% aged from 15 to 64 years old.

Cardiovascular diseases account for more than 25% of all deaths.
The names of many streets, towns, and provinces are also in Spanish.
Other Philippine languages, including various Visayan languages are also used, especially in radio due to its ability to reach remote rural locations that might otherwise not be serviced by other kinds of media.
Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, California.
He and his wife, Pat Nixon, moved to Washington to work for the federal government in 1942.
He subsequently served in the United States Navy during World War II.

In 1815, it was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.
A member of the BRIC group, Brazil until 2010 had one of the world's fastest growing major economies, with its economic reforms giving the country new international recognition and influence.
Brazil is a founding member of the United Nations, the G20, CPLP, Latin Union, the Organization of Ibero-American States, the Organization of American States, Mercosul and the Union of South American Nations.
By the end of the 17th century, sugarcane exports began to decline, and the discovery of gold by bandeirantes in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colony's economy, fostering a Brazilian Gold Rush, attracting thousands of new settlers to Brazil, from Portugal and all Portuguese colonies around the World, which in turn caused some conflicts between newcomers and old settlers.
Portuguese expeditions known as Bandeiras gradually advanced the Portugal colonial original frontiers in South America to approximately the current Brazilian borders.
In this era other European powers tried to colonize parts of Brazil, in incursions that the Portuguese had to fight, notably the French in Rio during the 1560s, in Maranhão during the 1610s, and the Dutch in Bahia and Pernambuco, during the Dutch–Portuguese War, after the end of Iberian Union.
===United Kingdom with Portugal===In late 1807, Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of continental Portugal, causing Prince Regent João, in the name of Queen Maria I, to move the royal court from Lisbon to Brazil.
There they established some of Brazil's first financial institutions, such as its local stock exchanges, a National Bank, and ended the monopoly of the colony trade with Portugal, opening it to other nations.
In 1815, in order to justify continuing to live in Brazil, where the royal court had thrived for the past six years, the Crown established the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves, thus creating a pluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state.
The Brazilians refused to yield, and Prince Pedro decided to stand with them, declaring the country's independence from Portugal on 7 September 1822.
With the last Portuguese soldiers surrendering on 8 March 1824, Portugal officially recognized Brazil on 29 August 1825.
This period of internal political and social upheaval, which included the Praieira revolt, was overcome only at the end of the 1840s, years after the end of the regency, which occurred with the premature coronation of Pedro II in 1841.
During the last phase of the monarchy, internal political debate was centered on the issue of slavery.
The Atlantic slave trade was abandoned in 1850, as a result of the British' Aberdeen Act, but only in May 1888 after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of slavery in the country, was the institution formally abolished.
The foreign affairs in the monarchy were basically related issues with the countries of the Southern Cone with which Brazil has borders.
Long after the Cisplatine War that resulted in independence for Uruguay, Brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of Pedro II.
These were the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the devastating Paraguayan War, the largest war effort in Brazilian history.
On 15 November 1889, worn out by years of economic stagnation, in attrition with the majority of Army officers, as well as with rural and financial elites (for different reasons), the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup.
Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power".
In 1894, following the unfoldings of two severe crises, an economic along with a military one, the republican civilians rose to power.
In the 1930s, three major attempts to remove Vargas and his supporters from power occurred: in the second half of 1932, in November 1935, and in May 1938.
In foreign policy, the success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries in the early years of the republican period, was followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the League of Nations, after its involvement in World War I.
In World War II Brazil remained neutral until August 1942, when the country entered on the allied side, after suffering retaliations undertaken by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, due to the country having severed diplomatic relations with them in the wake of the Pan-American Conference.
Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis, after having returned to power by election in 1950.
The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably, but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of Brasília, inaugurated in 1960.
Despite its brutality, like other totalitarian regimes in history, due to an economic boom, known as an "economic miracle", the regime reached its highest level of popularity in the early 1970s.
Slowly however, the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that have not slowed the repression, even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas, plus the inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure, made an opening policy inevitable, which from the regime side was led by Generals Geisel and Golbery.
With the enactment of the Amnesty Law in 1979, Brazil began its slow return to democracy, which would be completed during the 1980s.
In 1994, Cardoso produced a highly successful Plano Real, that, after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation, finally granted stability to the Brazilian economy, leading Cardoso to be elected that year, and again in 1998.
The peaceful transition of power from Fernando Henrique to his main opposition leader, Luís Inácio Lula da Silva, who was elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006, proved that Brazil had finally succeeded in achieving its long-sought political stability.
Lula was succeeded in 2011 by the current president, Dilma Rousseff, the country's first woman president and as such one of the most powerful women in the world.
For days, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in several cities to protest.
==Demographics==The population of Brazil, as recorded by the 2008 PNAD, was approximately 190 million (), with a ratio of men to women of 0.95:1 and 83.75% of the population defined as urban.
From 1880 to 1930, 4 million Europeans arrived.
Brazil's population increased significantly between 1940 and 1970, because of a decline in the mortality rate, even though the birth rate underwent a slight decline.
In the 1940s the annual population growth rate was 2.4%, rising to 3.0% in the 1950s and remaining at 2.9% in the 1960s, as life expectancy rose from 44 to 54 years and to 72.6 years in 2007.
It has been steadily falling since the 1960s, from 3.04% per year between 1950 and 1960 to 1.05% in 2008 and is expected to fall to a negative value of –0.29% by 2050 thus completing the demographic transition.
In 2008, the illiteracy rate was 11.48% and among the youth (ages 15–19) 1.74%.
It was highest (20.30%) in the Northeast, which had a large proportion of rural poor.
Illiteracy was high (24.18%) among the rural population and lower (9.05%) among the urban population.
===Race and ethnicity===According to the National Research by Household Sample (PNAD) of 2008, 48.43% of the population (about 92 million) described themselves as White; 43.80% (about 83 million) as Pardo (brown), 6.84% (about 13 million) as Black; 0.58% (about 1.1 million) as Asian; and 0.28% (about 536 thousand) as Amerindian (officially called "indígena", Indigenous), while 0.07% (about 130 thousand) did not declare their race.
From the 19th century, Brazil opened its borders to immigration.
About five million people from over 60 countries migrated to Brazil between 1808 and 1972, most of them of Portuguese, Italian, Spaniard, German, Ukrainian, Polish, Jewish, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Middle Eastern origin.
===Religion===Religion in Brazil formed from the meeting of the Catholic Church with the religious traditions of enslaved African peoples and indigenous peoples.
This confluence of faiths during the Portuguese colonization of Brazil led to the development of a diverse array of syncretistic practices within the overarching umbrella of Brazilian Catholicism, characterized by traditional Portuguese festivities, and in some instances, Allan Kardec's Spiritism (most Brazilian Spiritists are also Christians).
Catholicism is the country's predominant faith.
Brazil has the world's largest Catholic population.
According to the 2000 Demographic Census (the PNAD survey does not inquire about religion), 73.57% of the population followed Catholicism; 15.41% Protestantism; 1.33% Kardecist spiritism; 1.22% other Christian denominations; 0.31% Afro-Brazilian religions; 0.13% Buddhism; 0.05% Judaism; 0.02% Islam; 0.01% Amerindian religions; 0.59% other religions, undeclared or undetermined; while 7.35% have no religion.
After Protestantism, individuals professing no religion are also a significant group, exceeding 7% of the population in the 2000 census.
Teresina, Fortaleza, and Florianópolis were the most Roman Catholic in the country.
The national beverage is coffee and cachaça is Brazil's native liquor.
Cachaça is distilled from sugar cane and is the main ingredient in the national cocktail, Caipirinha.
An average meal consists mostly of rice and beans with beef and salad.
Often, it's mixed with cassava flour (farofa).
Fried potatoes, fried cassava, fried banana, fried meat and fried cheese are very often eaten in lunch and served in most typical restaurants.
Popular snacks are pastel (a pastry); coxinha (chicken croquete); pão de queijo (cheese bread and cassava flour / tapioca); pamonha (corn and milk paste); esfirra (Lebanese pastry); kibbeh (from Arabic cuisine); empanada (pastry) and empada, little salt pies filled with shrimps or heart of palm.
Brazil has a variety of candies such as brigadeiros (chocolate fudge balls), cocada (a coconut sweet), beijinhos (coconut truffles and clove) and romeu e julieta (cheese with a guava jam known as goiabada).
Peanuts are used to make paçoca, rapadura and pé-de-moleque.

The capital and largest city is Bangkok, which is Thailand's political, commercial, industrial, and cultural hub.
Thailand experienced rapid economic growth between 1985 and 1996, becoming a newly industrialised country and a major exporter.
It is bordered on the north by the United States; on the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; on the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and on the east by the Gulf of Mexico.
The latter led to the Mexican Revolution in 1910, which culminated with the promulgation of the 1917 Constitution and the emergence of the country's current political system.
In addition, Mexico was the first Latin American member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD (since 1994), and considered an upper-middle income country by the World Bank.

q233After New Spain won independence from Spain, it was decided that the new country would be named after its capital, Mexico City, which was founded in 1524 on top of the ancient Mexica capital of Mexico-Tenochtitlan.
The system of interconnected lakes, of which Texcoco formed the center, had the form of a rabbit, which the Mesoamericans pareidolically associated with the Moon.
This led to the use of the variant Méjico in many publications in Spanish, most notably in Spain, whereas in Mexico and most other Spanish–speaking countries México was the preferred spelling.
In recent years the Real Academia Española, which regulates the Spanish language, determined that both variants are acceptable in Spanish but that the normative recommended spelling is México.
In English, the 'x' in Mexico represents neither the original nor the current sound, but the consonant cluster .

When he suspended the 1824 Constitution, civil war spread across the country, and three new governments declared independence: the Republic of Texas, the Republic of the Rio Grande and the Republic of Yucatán.
Texas successfully achieved independence and joined the United States.
A border dispute led to the Mexican-American War, which began in 1846 and lasted for two years; the War was settled via the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which forced Mexico to give up over half of its land to the U.S., including Alta California, New Mexico, and the disputed parts of Texas.
That event re-ignited the civil war, involving figures such as Francisco Villa and Emiliano Zapata, who formed their own forces.
It is estimated that the war killed 900,000 of the 1910 population of 15 million.

Mexico is home to a large number of indigenous languages, spoken by some 5.4% of the population – 1.2% of the population are monolingual speakers of an indigenous language.
The indigenous languages with most speakers are Nahuatl, spoken by approximately 1.45 million people, Yukatek Maya spoken by some 750,000 people and the Mixtec and Zapotec languages each spoken by more than 400,000 people.
Since the promulgation of the Law of Indigenous Linguistic Rights in 2003, these languages have had status as national languages, with equal validity with Spanish in all the areas and contexts in which they are spoken.
In addition to the indigenous languages, other minority languages are spoken by immigrant populations, such as the 80,000 German-speaking Mennonites in Mexico, and 5,000 the Chipilo dialect of the Venetian language spoken in Chipilo, Puebla.

Maria Candelaria (1944) by Emilio Fernández, was one of the first films awarded a Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1946, the first time the event was held after World War II.
Some states, through their state agencies in charge of culture and the arts—Ministry or Secretary or Institute or Council of Culture, in some cases Secretary of Education or the State University—sponsor the activities of a professional Symphony Orchestra or Philharmonic Orchestra so all citizens can have access to this artistic expression from the field of classical music.

=== Independence (1960) ===On 1 January 1960 French Cameroun gained independence from France under President Ahmadou Ahidjo.
On 1 October 1961, the formerly British Southern Cameroons united with French Cameroun to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon.
Ahidjo used the ongoing war with the UPC to concentrate power in the presidency, continuing with this even after the suppression of the UPC in 1971.
His political party, the Cameroon National Union (CNU), became the sole legal political party on 1 September 1966 and in 1972, the federal system of government was abolished in favour of a United Republic of Cameroon, headed from Yaoundé.
The government used oil money to create a national cash reserve, pay farmers, and finance major development projects; however, many initiatives failed when Ahidjo appointed unqualified allies to direct them.
Ahidjo stepped down on 4 November 1982 and left power to his constitutional successor, Paul Biya.
An economic crisis took effect in the mid-1980s to late 1990s as a result of international economic conditions, drought, falling petroleum prices, and years of corruption, mismanagement, and cronyism.
Cameroon turned to foreign aid, cut government spending, and privatised industries.
In February 2008, Cameroon experienced its worst violence in 15 years when a transport union strike in Douala escalated into violent protests in 31 municipal areas.
The country's neighbours are Nigeria to the west; Chad to the northeast; the Central African Republic to the east; and Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and the Republic of the Congo to the south.
==Proton in chemistry=====Atomic number===In chemistry, the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is known as the atomic number, which determines the chemical element to which the atom belongs.
For example, the atomic number of chlorine is 17; this means that each chlorine atom has 17 protons and that all atoms with 17 protons are chlorine atoms.
For example, the charges of the proton and antiproton must sum to exactly zero.
This equality has been tested to one part in .
The equality of their masses has also been tested to better than one part in .
The electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton.
The exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of chemical bonding.
A decade later Benjamin Franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical fluid, but the same electrical fluid under different pressures.
Between 1838 and 1851, British natural philosopher Richard Laming developed the idea that an atom is composed of a core of matter surrounded by subatomic particles that had unit electric charges.
After studying the phenomenon of electrolysis in 1874, Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney suggested that there existed a "single definite quantity of electricity", the charge of a monovalent ion.
In 1876, the German physicist Eugen Goldstein showed that the rays from this glow cast a shadow, and he dubbed the rays cathode rays.
He then showed that the luminescence rays appearing within the tube carried energy and moved from the cathode to the anode.
However, this produced a value that was more than a thousand times greater than what was expected, so little credence was given to his calculations at the time.
In 1896, the British physicist J. J. Thomson, with his colleagues John S. Townsend and H. A. Wilson, performed experiments indicating that cathode rays really were unique particles, rather than waves, atoms or molecules as was believed earlier.
This evidence strengthened the view that electrons existed as components of atoms.
This experiment used an electric field to prevent a charged droplet of oil from falling as a result of gravity.
This device could measure the electric charge from as few as 1–150 ions with an error margin of less than 0.3%.
The electrons could move between these states, or orbits, by the emission or absorption of photons at specific frequencies.
With this model Langmuir was able to qualitatively explain the chemical properties of all elements in the periodic table, which were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law.
To resolve some problems within his relativistic equation, in 1930 Dirac developed a model of the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles having negative energy, which was dubbed the Dirac sea.
The first successful attempt to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction was made in 1942 by Donald Kerst.
His initial betatron reached energies of 2.3 MeV, while subsequent betatrons achieved 300 MeV.
In 1947, synchrotron radiation was discovered with a 70 MeV electron synchrotron at General Electric.
This radiation was caused by the acceleration of electrons, moving near the speed of light, through a magnetic field.
On the basis of Einstein's principle of mass–energy equivalence, this mass corresponds to a rest energy of 0.511 MeV.
Astronomical measurements show that the proton-to-electron mass ratio has held the same value for at least half the age of the universe, as is predicted by the Standard Model.
However, the electron is thought to be stable on theoretical grounds: the electron is the least massive particle with non-zero electric charge, so its decay would violate charge conservation.
When the absolute value of this function is squared, it gives the probability that a particle will be observed near a location—a probability density.
Electrons are identical particles because they cannot be distinguished from each other by their intrinsic physical properties.
In quantum mechanics, this means that a pair of interacting electrons must be able to swap positions without an observable change to the state of the system.
In the case of antisymmetry, solutions of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same location or state.
This principle explains many of the properties of electrons.
The interaction with virtual particles also explains the small (about 0.1%) deviation of the intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron from the Bohr magneton (the anomalous magnetic moment).
When an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic field.
The acceleration from this curving motion induces the electron to radiate energy in the form of synchrotron radiation.
Such interaction between the light and free electrons is called Thomson scattering or Linear Thomson scattering.
Charge is conserved during this reaction because the W boson also carries a charge, canceling out any net change during the transmutation.
If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such an atom is called an ion.
Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus.
===Conductivity===[[File:Lightning over Oradea Romania cropped.jpg_right_thumb_alt=Four bolts of lightning strike the ground_A lightning discharge consists primarily of a flow of electrons.
(Cooper pairs have a radius of roughly 100 nm, so they can overlap each other.
The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum, "c".
As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.
The effects of special relativity are based on a quantity known as the Lorentz factor, defined as formula_1 where "v" is the speed of the particle.
The kinetic energy "K"e of an electron moving with velocity "v" is::formula_2where "m"e is the mass of electron.
For the 51 GeV electron above, the wavelength is about , small enough to explore structures well below the size of an atomic nucleus.
==Formation==The Big Bang theory is the most widely accepted scientific theory to explain the early stages in the evolution of the Universe.
For the first millisecond of the Big Bang, the temperatures were over 10 billion Kelvin and photons had mean energies over a million electronvolts.
Likewise, positron-electron pairs annihilated each other and emitted energetic photons:An equilibrium between electrons, positrons and photons was maintained during this phase of the evolution of the Universe.
Roughly one million years after the big bang, the first generation of stars began to form.
However, the process of stellar evolution can result in the synthesis of radioactive isotopes.
However, quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of Hawking radiation at this distance.
Electrons (and positrons) are thought to be created at the event horizon of these stellar remnants.
The magnetic moment of the electron was measured to a precision of eleven digits, which, in 1980, was a greater accuracy than for any other physical constant.
ARPES can be used to determine the direction, speed and scattering of electrons within the material.
==Plasma applications=====Particle beams===[[File:Nasa Shuttle Test Using Electron Beam full.jpg_right_thumb_alt=A violet beam from above produces a blue glow about a Space shuttle model_During a NASA wind tunnel test, a model of the Space Shuttle is targeted by a beam of electrons, simulating the effect of ionizing gases during re-entry.
For this reason, EBL is primarily used for the production of small numbers of specialized integrated circuits.
Electron therapy can treat such skin lesions as basal-cell carcinomas because an electron beam only penetrates to a limited depth before being absorbed, typically up to 5 cm for electron energies in the range 5–20 MeV.
The electrons emit synchrotron radiation that coherently interacts with the same electrons to strongly amplify the radiation field at the resonance frequency.
These devices may find manufacturing, communication and various medical applications, such as soft tissue surgery.
Argentina stayed neutral during World War I.
A new military coup toppled the government, and Argentina declared war on the Axis Powers a month before the end of World War II in Europe.
However, her declining health did not allow her to run for the vice-presidency in 1951, and she died of cancer the following year.
==Geography==With a mainland surface area of , Argentina is located in southern South America, sharing land borders with Chile across the Andes to the west; Bolivia and Paraguay to the north; Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east; and the Drake Passage to the south; for an overall land border length of .
The lowest point is Laguna del Carbón in the "San Julián Great Depression" Santa Cruz province ( below sea level, also the lowest point in the Southern and Western Hemispheres, and the seventh lowest point on Earth)The northernmost point is at the confluence of the Grande de San Juan and Río Mojinete rivers in Jujuy province; the southernmost is Cape San Pío in Tierra del Fuego province; the easternmost is northeast of Bernardo de Irigoyen, Misiones and the westernmost is within Los Glaciares National Park in Santa Cruz province.
* Sierras Pampeanas, a series of medium-height mountain chains located in the center.
* Patagonia, a large southern plateau consisting mostly of arid, rocky steppes to the east, moister cold grasslands to the south and dense subantarctic forests to the west.
Seats are apportioned among the provinces by population every tenth year.
At least one-third of the candidates presented by the parties must be women.
In 2012 Argentina was elected again to a two-year non-permanent position on the United Nations Security Council and is participating in major peacekeeping operations in Haiti, Cyprus, Western Sahara and the Middle East.
A prominent Latin American and Southern Cone regional power, Argentina co-founded OEI, CELAC and UNASUR, of which the former president Néstor Kirchner was first Secretary General.
:Military service is voluntary, with enlistment age between 18 and 24 years old and no conscription.
===Urbanization===Argentina is highly urbanized, with 92% of its population living in cities: the ten largest metropolitan areas account for half of the population.
About 3 million people live in the city of Buenos Aires, and including the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area it totals around 13 million, making it one of the largest urban areas in the world.
The population is unequally distributed: about 60% live in the Pampas region (21% of the total area), including 15 million people in Buenos Aires province.
Health care cooperatives number over 300 (of which 200 are related to labor unions) and provide health care for half the population; the national INSSJP (popularly known as PAMI) covers nearly all of the five million senior citizens.
The relatively high access to medical care has historically resulted in mortality patterns and trends similar to developed nations': from 1953 to 2005, deaths from cardiovascular disease increased from 20% to 23% of the total, those from tumors from 14% to 20%, respiratory problems from 7% to 14%, digestive maladies (non-infectious) from 7% to 11%, strokes a steady 7%, injuries, 6%, and infectious diseases, 4%.
Causes related to senility led to many of the rest.
Infant deaths have fallen from 19% of all deaths in 1953 to 3% in 2005.
The availability of health care has also reduced infant mortality from 70 per 1000 live births in 1948 to 12.1 in 2009 and raised life expectancy at birth from 60 years to 76.
Though these figures compare favorably with global averages, they fall short of levels in developed nations and in 2006, Argentina ranked fourth in Latin America.
Such positions also allowed him to play a central role in training the militia forces who repelled the Bay of Pigs Invasion and bringing the Soviet nuclear-armed ballistic missiles to Cuba which precipitated the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.
His favorite subjects in school included philosophy, mathematics, engineering, political science, sociology, history and archaeology.
They set out for Cuba on November 25, 1956.
The following day on January 2, Guevara entered Havana to take final control of the capital.
Fidel Castro took 6 more days to arrive, as he stopped to rally support in several large cities on his way to rolling victoriously into Havana on January 8, 1959.
When Hilda Gadea arrived in Cuba in late January, Guevara told her that he was involved with another woman, and the two agreed on a divorce, which was finalized on May 22.
On June 2, 1959, he married Aleida March, a Cuban-born member of the 26th of July movement with whom he had been living since late 1958.
To implement a portion of this plan, Castro named Guevara commander of the La Cabaña Fortress prison, for a five-month tenure (January 2 through June 12, 1959).
The law also stipulated that sugar plantations could not be owned by foreigners.
"In August 1961, during an economic conference of the Organization of American States in Punta del Este, Uruguay, Che Guevara sent a note of "gratitude" to United States President John F. Kennedy through Richard N. Goodwin, a young secretary of the White House.
"Guevara, who was practically the architect of the Soviet-Cuban relationship, then played a key role in bringing to Cuba the Soviet nuclear-armed ballistic missiles that precipitated the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 and brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.
A few weeks after the crisis, during an interview with the British communist newspaper the "Daily Worker", Guevara was still fuming over the perceived Soviet betrayal and told correspondent Sam Russell that, if the missiles had been under Cuban control, they would have fired them off.
His whereabouts were a great mystery in Cuba, as he was generally regarded as second in power to Castro himself.
==Congo==In early 1965, Guevara went to Africa to offer his knowledge and experience as a guerrilla to the ongoing conflict in the Congo.
He led the Cuban operation in support of the Marxist Simba movement, which had emerged from the ongoing Congo crisis.
In a speech at the 1967 International Workers' Day rally in Havana, the acting minister of the armed forces, Major Juan Almeida, announced that Guevara was "serving the revolution somewhere in Latin America".
But in August 1967, the Bolivian Army managed to eliminate two guerrilla groups in a violent battle, reportedly killing one of the leaders.
Debray described a destitute situation where Guevara's men suffered malnutrition, lack of water, absence of shoes, and only possessed six blankets for 22 men.
" In his homeland of Argentina, where high schools bear his name, numerous Che museums dot the country, which in 2008 unveiled a bronze statue of him in the city of his birth, Rosario.

Faraday ultimately became the first and foremost Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, a lifetime position.
In 1847 he discovered that the optical properties of gold colloids differed from those of the corresponding bulk metal.
Dubbed "The Wizard of Menlo Park", he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention, and because of that, he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.
He also studied qualitative analysis, and conducted chemical experiments on the train until an accident prohibited further work of the kind.
These talents eventually led him to found 14 companies, including General Electric, which is still one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world.
One night in 1867, he was working with a lead–acid battery when he spilled sulfuric acid onto the floor.
One of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named Franklin Leonard Pope, who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his Elizabeth, New Jersey, home.
Doctors frequently prescribed morphine to women in those years to treat a variety of causes, and researchers believe that some of her symptoms sounded as if they were associated with morphine poisoning.
Mina outlived Thomas Edison, dying on August 24, 1947.
Edison became known as "The Wizard of Menlo Park," New Jersey.
Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction.
However, Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device.
In his first year, the plant under General Manager Francis Robbins Upton turned out 50,000 lamps.
Nearly all of Edison's patents were utility patents, which were protected for a 17-year period and included inventions or processes that are electrical, mechanical, or chemical in nature.
About a dozen were design patents, which protect an ornamental design for up to a 14-year period.
The first successful test was on October 22, 1879; it lasted 13.5 hours.
The idea of using this particular raw material originated from Edison's recalling his examination of a few threads from a bamboo fishing pole while relaxing on the shore of Battle Lake in the present-day state of Wyoming, where he and other members of a scientific team had traveled so that they could clearly observe a total eclipse of the sun on July 29, 1878, from the Continental Divide.
Latimer worked as an engineer, a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation on electric lights.
On October 8, 1883, the US patent office ruled that Edison's patent was based on the work of William Sawyer and was therefore invalid.
In September 2010, a sculpture of three giant light bulbs was erected in Brno, in front of the theatre.
The company established the first investor-owned electric utility in 1882 on Pearl Street Station, New York City.
It was on September 4, 1882, that Edison switched on his Pearl Street generating station's electrical power distribution system, which provided 110 volts direct current (DC) to 59 customers in lower Manhattan.
Earlier in the year, in January 1882, he had switched on the first steam-generating power station at Holborn Viaduct in London.
In 1885, Thomas Edison had bought property in Fort Myers, Florida, and built what was later called Seminole Lodge as a winter retreat.
This fleet of cars would serve commuters in northern New Jersey for the next 54 years until their retirement in 1984.
In 1930, the year before Edison died, Mina said in an interview about him, "correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies.
" She also said that during one of his periodic "great scientific adventures", Edison would be up at 7:00, have breakfast at 8:00, and be rarely home for lunch or dinner, implying that he continued to have all three.
Edison became the owner of his Milan, Ohio, birthplace in 1906.
==Death==Edison died of complications of diabetes on October 18, 1931, in his home, "Glenmont" in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey, which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina.
Mina died in 1947.
The Philadelphia City Council named Edison the recipient of the John Scott Medal in 1889.
In 1899, Edison was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal of The Franklin Institute.
In 1927, he was granted membership in the National Academy of Sciences.
In 2008, Edison was inducted in the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

After becoming one of the first members of the Council of Europe in 1949, Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963, joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 and started full membership negotiations with the European Union in 2005.
The first major empire in the area was founded by the Hittites, from the 18th through the 13th century BC.
Turkey remained neutral during most of World War II, but entered the closing stages of the war on the side of the Allies on 23 February 1945.
Universal suffrage for both sexes has been applied throughout Turkey since 1933, and every Turkish citizen who has turned 18 years of age has the right to vote.
Human rights in Turkey have been the subject of some controversy and international condemnation.
Between 1998 and 2008 the European Court of Human Rights made more than 1,600 judgements against Turkey for human rights violations, particularly regarding the right to life, and freedom from torture.
Other issues, such as Kurdish rights, women's rights, and press freedom, have also attracted controversy.
Turkey's human rights record continues to be a significant obstacle to future membership of the EU.

By 1775, Africans made up 20% of the population in the American colonies, which made them the second largest ethnic group after the English.
In 1860, at the start of the Civil War, the African-American population had increased to 4.4 million, but the percentage rate dropped to 14% of the overall population of the country.
By 1900, the black population had doubled and reached 8.8 million.
At the time of the 2000 Census, 54.8% of African Americans lived in the South.
According to the 2000 Census, approximately 2.05% of African Americans identified as Hispanic or Latino in origin, many of whom may be of Brazilian, Puerto Rican, Dominican, Cuban, Haitian, or other Latin American descent.
Chicago has the second largest black population, with almost 1.6 million African Americans in its metropolitan area, representing about 18 percent of the total metropolitan population.
Other large cities with African-American majorities include New Orleans, Louisiana (60%), Baltimore, Maryland (63%) Atlanta, Georgia (54%, see African Americans in Atlanta), Memphis, Tennessee (61%), and Washington, D.C. (50.7%).
Within that county, among the wealthiest communities are Glenn Dale, Maryland and Fort Washington, Maryland.
Queens County, New York is the only county with a population of 65,000 or more where African Americans have a higher median household income than White Americans.
Of the total number of Jehovah's Witnesses, 22% are black.
Historically, between 15 to 30% of enslaved Africans brought to the Americas were Muslims, but most of these Africans were converted to Christianity during the era of American slavery.
However during the 20th century, some African Americans converted to Islam, mainly through the influence of black nationalist groups that preached with distinctive Islamic practices; these include the Moorish Science Temple of America, though the largest organization was the Nation of Islam, founded during the 1930s, which attracted at least 20,000 people as of 1963, prominent members included activist Malcolm X and boxer Muhammad Ali.
However, few members rejected these changes, in particular Louis Farrakhan, who revived the Nation of Islam in 1978 based on its original teachings.
The Amazon basin is the largest drainage basin in the world, about , and accounts for approximately one-fifth of the world's total river flow.
The quantity of water released by the Amazon to the Atlantic Ocean is enormous: up to in the rainy season, with an average of from 1973 to 1990.
The low river banks are interrupted by only a few hills, and the river enters the enormous Amazon rainforest.
The lower Amazon seems to have once been a gulf of the Atlantic Ocean, the waters of which washed the cliffs near Óbidos.
Only about ten percent of the Amazon's water enters downstream of Óbidos, very little of which is from the northern slope of the valley.
In the lower reaches of the river, the north bank consists of a series of steep, table-topped hills extending for about from opposite the mouth of the Xingu as far as Monte Alegre.
These hills are cut down to a kind of terrace which lies between them and the river.
The tucuxi ("Sotalia fluviatilis"), also a dolphin species, is found both in the rivers of the Amazon basin and in the coastal waters of South America.
For instance the pre-Columbian culture on the island of Marajó may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000 people.
The total population of the Brazilian portion of the Amazon basin in 1850 was perhaps 300,000, of whom about two-thirds comprised by Europeans and slaves, the slaves amounting to about 25,000.
The town of Manáos, now Manaus, at the mouth of the Rio Negro, had a population between 1,000 to 1,500.
This was the first step in opening up the vast interior.
The Brazilian decree took effect on 7 September 1867.
Four centuries after the European discovery of the Amazon river, the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than , excluding the limited and crudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters.
This situation changed dramatically during the 20th century.
In 1960, the construction of the new capital city of Brasília in the interior also contributed to the opening up of the Amazon basin.
==Dispute regarding length==While debate as to whether the Amazon or the Nile is the world's longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest.
A study by Brazilian scientists concluded that the Amazon is actually longer than the Nile.
Guido Gelli, director of science at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), told the Brazilian TV network Globo in June 2007 that it could be considered as a fact that the Amazon was the longest river in the world.
The highest point on the Equator is at the elevation of , at , found on the southern slopes of Volcán Cayambe in Ecuador.
Usually, average annual temperature is around during the day and at night.
In November 1821, at the age of 15, he was admitted to Florence Academy of Fine Arts as its youngest student, where he studied chemical and mechanical engineering.
== Electromagnetic telephone ==Meucci studied the principles of electromagnetic voice transmission for many years and was able to realize his dream of transmitting his voice through wires in 1856.
===2BSD (PDP-11)===The Second Berkeley Software Distribution (2BSD), released in May 1979, included updated versions of the 1BSD software as well as two new programs by Joy that persist on Unix systems to this day: the vi text editor (a visual version of ex) and the C shell.
Later releases of 2BSD contained ports of changes to the VAX-based releases of BSD back to the PDP-11 architecture.
===3BSD===A VAX computer was installed at Berkeley in 1978, but the port of Unix to the VAX architecture, UNIX/32V, did not take advantage of the VAX's virtual memory capabilities.
The kernel of 32V was largely rewritten by Berkeley students to include a virtual memory implementation, and a complete operating system including the new kernel, ports of the 2BSD utilities to the VAX, and the utilities from 32V was released as 3BSD at the end of 1979.
", wrote:===4.1BSD===4.1BSD (June 1981) was a response to criticisms of BSD's performance relative to the dominant VAX operating system, VMS.
The 4.1BSD kernel was systematically tuned up by Bill Joy until it could perform as well as VMS on several benchmarks.
Its main changes were to improve the performance of many of the new contributions of 4.2BSD that had not been as heavily tuned as the 4.1BSD code.
Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing.
Christian rap is currently the most commercially successful form of religious rap.
Out of 190,638 households, 29.9% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 28.5% were married couples living together, 24.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 41.3% were nonfamilies.
35.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 11.1% had someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older.
The average household size was 2.44 and the average family size was 3.19.
The population was spread out with 28.5% under the age of 18, 9.5% from 18 to 24, 30.4% from 25 to 44, 19.0% from 45 to 64, and 12.5% who are 65 years of age or older.
The median age was 33 years.
For every 100 females there were 90.0 males.
For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 85.2 males.
26.3% of the population and 22.9% of families were below the poverty line.
Out of the total population, 37.6% of those under the age of 18 and 16.8% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.
It is written, spoken and used in all provinces/territories of Pakistan despite the fact that the people from differing provinces may have different indigenous languages, as from the fact that it is the "base language" of the country.
It is absorbing many words from the regional languages of Pakistan.
So although most of the population is conversant in Urdu, it is the first language of only an estimated 7% of the population who are mainly Muslim immigrants (known as Muhajir in Pakistan) from different parts of South Asia.
There are millions of Pakistanis whose native language is not Urdu, but because they have studied in Urdu medium schools, they can read and write Urdu along with their native language.
Most of the nearly five million Afghan refugees of different ethnic origins (such as Pashtun, Tajik, Uzbek, Hazarvi, and Turkmen) who stayed in Pakistan for over twenty-five years have also become fluent in Urdu.
In India, Urdu is spoken in places where there are large Muslim minorities or cities that were bases for Muslim Empires in the past.
Indian madrasahs also teach Arabic as well as Urdu.
It is distinct by its mixture of vocabulary from Marathi and Konkani, as well as some vocabulary from Arabic, Persian and Turkish that are not found in the standard dialect of Urdu.
A number of daily newspapers and several monthly magazines in Urdu are published in these states.
There are also a smaller number of borrowings from Chagatai, Portuguese, and more recently English.
Many of the words of Arabic origin have been adopted through Persian and have different pronunciations and nuances of meaning and usage than they do in Arabic.
== Writing system ===== Urdu script ===Urdu is written right-to left in an extension of the Persian alphabet, which is itself an extension of the Arabic alphabet.
Until the late 19th century, all proceedings and court transactions in this register of Urdu were written officially in the Persian script.
Roman Urdu has been used since the days of the British Raj, partly as a result of the availability and low cost of Roman movable type for printing presses.
The use of Roman Urdu was common in contexts such as product labels.
Habib R. Sulemani says,"The younger generation of Urdu-speaking people around the world, especially Pakistan, are using Romanised Urdu on the Internet and it has become essential for them, because they use the Internet and English is its language.
Typically, in that sense, a person from Islamabad in Pakistan may chat with another in Delhi in India on the Internet only in Roman Urdū.
Moreover, the younger generation of those who are from the English medium schools or settled in the west, can speak Urdu but can’t write it in the traditional Arabic script and thus Roman Urdu is a blessing for such a population.
Thus Roman Urdū was a common way of writing among Pakistani and Indian Christians in these areas up to the 1960s.
The Bible Society of India publishes Roman Urdū Bibles that enjoyed sale late into the 1960s (though they are still published today).
Church songbooks are also common in Roman Urdū.
However, the usage of Roman Urdū is declining with the wider use of Hindi and English in these states.
Microsoft has included Urdu language support in all new versions of Windows and both Windows Vista and Microsoft Office 2007 are available in Urdu through Language Interface Pack support.

The tattoo art was a sacred marker of identity among the Maori and also referred to as a vehicle for storing one's tapu, or spiritual being, in the afterlife.
Over time tattoos have become increasingly popular in the U.S., and according to a study in 2006; nearly 25 percent of Americans between the ages of eighteen and fifty have one or more tattoos.
The most common method of tattooing in modern times is the electric tattoo machine, which inserts ink into the skin via a single needle or a group of needles that are soldered onto a bar, which is attached to an oscillating unit.
The unit rapidly and repeatedly drives the needles in and out of the skin, usually 80 to 150 times a second.
The equipment must be sterilized in a certified autoclave before and after every use.
In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work.
In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky.
A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature.
In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectricity, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which nerve cells passed signals to the muscles.
The electromagnetic force is very strong, second only in strength to the strong interaction, but unlike that force it operates over all distances.
A hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface.
The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field in the air to greater than it can withstand.
While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere.
The force on the compass needle did not direct it to or away from the current-carrying wire, but acted at right angles to it.
This relationship between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for it led to Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821.
A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury.
Thus, when either field is changing in time, then a field of the other is necessarily induced.
Maxwell developed a set of equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between electric field, magnetic field, electric charge, and electric current.
He could moreover prove that such a wave would necessarily travel at the speed of light, and thus light itself was a form of electromagnetic radiation.
The United States showed a 12% increase in demand during each year of the first three decades of the twentieth century, a rate of growth that is now being experienced by emerging economies such as those of India or China.
Historically, the growth rate for electricity demand has outstripped that for other forms of energy.
Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting.
A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of electric heating in new buildings.
Optical fibre and satellite communication have taken a share of the market for communications systems, but electricity can be expected to remain an essential part of the process.
Certain crystals, such as quartz, or even sugar, generate a potential difference across their faces when subjected to external pressure.
The effect is reciprocal, and when a piezoelectric material is subjected to an electric field, a small change in physical dimensions takes place.
Faraday answered, “One day sir, you may tax it.”In the 19th and early 20th century, electricity was not part of the everyday life of many people, even in the industrialised Western world.

Aluminium atoms are arranged in a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure.
Most meteorite scientists believe that the energy released by the decay of 26Al was responsible for the melting and differentiation of some asteroids after their formation 4.55 billion years ago.
====Aluminium(I)====AlF, AlCl and AlBr exist in the gaseous phase when the trihalide is heated with aluminium.
The great majority of this material is converted to metallic aluminium.
Aluminium sulfate (Al2(SO4)3·(H2O)18) is produced on the annual scale of several billions of kilograms.
About half of the production is consumed in water treatment.
It is also used as a mordant, in fire extinguisher, as a food additive, in fireproofing, and in leather tanning.
Aluminium ammonium sulfate, which is also called ammonium alum, (NH4)Al(SO4)2·12H2O, is used as a mordant and in leather tanning.
The consumption of both alums is declining.
Aluminium borate (Al2O3·B2O3) is used in the production of glass and ceramics.
Aluminium fluorosilicate (Al2(SiF6)3) is used in the production of synthetic gemstones, glass and ceramic.
Aluminium phosphate (AlPO4) is used in the manufacture: of glass and ceramic, pulp and paper products, cosmetics, paints and varnishes and in making dental cement.
Héroult's process was in production by 1889 in Switzerland at Aluminium Industrie, now Alcan, and at British Aluminium, now Luxfer Group and Alcoa, by 1896 in Scotland.
Information engineering (IE) or information engineering methodology (IEM) is a software engineering approach to designing and developing information systems.
Each of these inventions is consistent with the modern definition of engineering, exploiting basic mechanical principles to develop useful tools and objects.

For a simplified notion of a wormhole, visualize space as a two-dimensional (2D) surface.
For example, instead of circular holes on a 2D plane, the entry and exit points could be visualized as spheres in 3D space.
Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.
In 1884, the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented a filter (known today as the Chamberland filter or Chamberland-Pasteur filter) with pores smaller than bacteria.
At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium – this was part of the germ theory of disease.
Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature, a theory later discredited by Wendell Stanley, who proved they were particulate.
Counting these areas and multiplying by the dilution factor allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the original suspension.
Viruses had been grown only in plants and animals.
Another breakthrough came in 1931, when the American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture grew influenza and several other viruses in fertilized chickens' eggs.
This work enabled Jonas Salk to make an effective polio vaccine.
The tobacco mosaic virus was the first to be crystallised and its structure could therefore be elucidated in detail.
On the basis of her pictures, Rosalind Franklin discovered the full structure of the virus in 1955.
The second half of the 20th century was the golden age of virus discovery and most of the over 2,000 recognised species of animal, plant, and bacterial viruses were discovered during these years.
In 1963, the hepatitis B virus was discovered by Baruch Blumberg, and in 1965, Howard Temin described the first retrovirus.
== Origins ==Viruses are found wherever there is life and have probably existed since living cells first evolved.
In general, viruses are much smaller than bacteria.
Most viruses that have been studied have a diameter between 20 and 300 nanometres.
This tail structure acts like a molecular syringe, attaching to the bacterial host and then injecting the viral genome into the cell.
There are millions of different types of viruses, although only about 5,000 of them have been described in detail.
A virus has either a DNA or an RNA genome and is called a DNA virus or an RNA virus, respectively.
Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell.
Beyond this limit, errors in the genome when replicating render the virus useless or uncompetitive.
The life cycle of viruses differs greatly between species but there are six "basic" stages in the life cycle of viruses:Attachment is a specific binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface.
Other viruses, such as rabies virus, can infect different species of mammals and are said to have a broad range.
Viruses must generate mRNAs from their genomes to produce proteins and replicate themselves, but different mechanisms are used to achieve this in each virus family.
Many serious diseases such as Ebola virus disease, AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses.
There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.
To control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered.
Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms.
It is unclear how many Native Americans were killed by foreign diseases after the arrival of Columbus in the Americas, but the numbers have been estimated to be close to 70% of the indigenous population.
A pandemic is a worldwide epidemic.
Most researchers believe that HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century; it is now a pandemic, with an estimated 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide.
The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognised on 5 June 1981, making it one of the most destructive epidemics in recorded history.
Marburg virus, first discovered in 1967, attracted widespread press attention in April 2005 for an outbreak in Angola.
Viral cancers occur only in a minority of infected persons (or animals).
The development of cancer is determined by a variety of factors such as host immunity and mutations in the host.
The most recently discovered human cancer virus is a polyomavirus (Merkel cell polyomavirus) that causes most cases of a rare form of skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma.
Hepatitis viruses can develop into a chronic viral infection that leads to liver cancer.
Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).
When such a virus infects a cell, it releases its RNA molecule or molecules, which immediately bind to a protein complex called a dicer that cuts the RNA into smaller pieces.
The first, called IgM, is highly effective at neutralizing viruses but is produced by the cells of the immune system only for a few weeks.
The presence of IgM in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection, whereas IgG indicates an infection sometime in the past.
=== Prevention and treatment ===Because viruses use vital metabolic pathways within host cells to replicate, they are difficult to eliminate without using drugs that cause toxic effects to host cells in general.
Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine.
The yellow fever virus vaccine, a live-attenuated strain called 17D, is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated.
Other antiviral drugs in use target different stages of the viral life cycle.
In 80% of people infected, the disease is chronic, and without treatment, they are infected for the remainder of their lives.
The treatment of chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by using a similar strategy using lamivudine has been developed.
One of the most effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes.
Within a short amount of time, in some cases just minutes, bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein.
These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins, which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis.
Bacteria also contain a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of viruses that the bacteria have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block the virus's replication through a form of RNA interference.
These viruses have been studied in most detail in the thermophilic archaea, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales.
=== Weapons ===The ability of viruses to cause devastating epidemics in human societies has led to the concern that viruses could be weaponised for biological warfare.
The smallpox virus devastated numerous societies throughout history before its eradication.
Fears that it may be used as a weapon may not be totally unfounded.
Other poets completed the "epic cycle", but these later and lesser poems now are lost almost entirely.
Thus Greek mythology unfolds as a phase in the development of the world and of humans.
In Germany, by about 1795, there was a growing interest in Homer and Greek mythology.
* L. Burn, "Greek Myths", 75&lt;/ref&gt; From the early years of Renaissance, artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, portrayed the Pagan subjects of Greek mythology alongside more conventional Christian themes.

With the second-highest human development index globally, Australia ranks highly in many international comparisons of national performance, such as quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, and the protection of civil liberties and political rights.
In 1770, James Cook sailed along and mapped the east coast, which he named New South Wales and claimed for Great Britain.
A British settlement was established in Van Diemen's Land, now known as Tasmania, in 1803 and it became a separate colony in 1825.
Separate colonies were carved from parts of New South Wales: South Australia in 1836, Victoria in 1851, and Queensland in 1859.
The indigenous population, estimated to have been between 750,000 and 1,000,000 at the time European settlement began, declined for 150 years following settlement, mainly due to infectious disease.
The Federal Capital Territory (later renamed the Australian Capital Territory) was formed in 1911 as the location for the future federal capital of Canberra.
Of about 416,000 who served, about 60,000 were killed and another 152,000 were wounded.
Since 1951, Australia has been a formal military ally of the US, under the ANZUS treaty.
The country was ranked second in the United Nations 2011 Human Development Index and first in Legatum's 2008 Prosperity Index.
The indirect tax system was substantially changed in July 2000 with the introduction of a 10% Goods and Services Tax (GST).
In Australia's tax system, personal and company income tax are the main sources of government revenue.

His birthday is one of the most important public holidays in the country.
Media and government sources from outside of North Korea generally support this view, while North Korean government sources say that it is genuine hero worship.
B. R. Myers also argues that the worship is real and not unlike worship of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany.

The Italian manuscript has 506 pages, of which the Gospel of Barnabas fills pages 43 to 500, written within red frames in an Islamic style.
The preceding pages 5 to 42 are also red framed; but remain blank (other than for Cramer's presentation to Prince Eugene), and it may be inferred that some sort of preface or preliminary text was intended, although the space is much greater than would have been needed for the text of the corresponding Spanish Preface.
Its binding is Turkish, and appears to be original; but the paper has an Italian watermark, which has been dated between 1563 and 1620.
The writer is not a professional scribe.
The linguistic experts consulted by the Raggs concluded that the Vienna manuscript was most likely the work of an older Venetian scribe, copying a Tuscan original, and writing in the second half of the 16th century.
Apart from the surviving Sydney transcript, the Spanish text survives in three passages quoted by Sale in Spanish, and in nine chapters quoted by White in English translation.
The Sydney transcript has 130 pages, but does not contain the entire text, as at the bottom of page 116 there is a note "Cap 121 to 200 wanting", and page 117 resumes at chapter 200 (in the Spanish numeration).
Comparing the Sydney transcript with the counterpart passages quoted in Spanish by Sale, there are no substantial differences, but it would appear that sometime between Sale's death in 1736 and 1745 some 80 chapters of the Spanish manuscript were lost.
Other researchers have noted a range of textual similarities between passages in the Gospel of Barnabas, and variously the texts of a series of late medieval vernacular harmonies of the four canonical gospels (in Middle English and Middle Dutch, but especially in Middle Italian); which are all speculated as deriving from a lost Vetus Latina version of the Diatessaron of Tatian .
If true, this would also support an Italian origin.
These scholars note parallels with a series of Morisco forgeries, the Lead Books of Sacromonte, dating from the 1590s; or otherwise with Morisco reworkings of Christian and Islamic traditions, produced following the expulsion of the Moriscos from Spain.
A detailed comparison between the surviving Italian and Spanish texts shows numerous places where the Spanish reading appears to be secondary, as for example, where a word or phrase necessary for the meaning is missing in the Spanish text but present in the Italian.
Joosten, however, while accepting that the carelessness of the English scribe is the most likely explanation for most such instances, nevertheless argues that a minority of such readings are inherently more likely to be due to translation errors in the Spanish text.
In particular, he sees the Spanish text as containing numerous 'Italicisms' as, for example, where the Italian text employs the conjunction "pero", with an Italian meaning 'therefore'; while the Spanish text also reads "pero", with a Spanish meaning 'however'; the Italian sense being the one demanded by the context.
There are, however, other passages where the Spanish reading makes sense, while the Italian does not, and many features of the Italian text that are not found in the Spanish; such as the titles for chapters 1–27.
Few academics argue that the text, in its present form, dates back any earlier than the 14th–16th centuries; although a minority see it as containing portions of an earlier work, and almost all would detect the influence of earlier sources—over and above the Vulgate text of the Latin Bible.
Consequently most researchers would concur with a stratification of the surviving text into at least three distinct layers of composition:* an editorial layer dating from the late 16th century; and comprising, at the least, the Spanish preface and the Arabic annotations,* a layer of vernacular narrative composition, either in Spanish or Italian, and dating from no earlier than the mid-14th century,* a layer derived from earlier source materials, almost certainly transmitted to the vernacular author/translator in Latin; and comprising, at the least, those extensive passages in the Gospel of Barnabas that closely parallel pericopes in the canonical gospels; but whose underlying text appears markedly distinct from that of the late medieval Latin Vulgate (as for instance in the alternative version of the Lord's Prayer in chapter 37, which includes a concluding doxology, contrary to the Vulgate text, but in accordance with the Diatessaron and many other early variant traditions);Much of the controversy and dispute concerning the authenticity of the Gospel of Barnabas can be re-expressed as debating whether specific highly transgressive themes (from an orthodox Christian perspective) might already have been present in the source materials utilised by a 14th–16th-century vernacular author, whether they might be due to that author himself, or whether they might even have been interpolated by the subsequent editor.
Those researchers who regard these particular themes as primitive, nevertheless do not generally dispute that other parts of the Gospel may be late and anachronistic; while those researchers who reject the authenticity of these particular themes do not generally dispute that other parts of the Gospel could be transmitting variant readings from antiquity.

By the close of the century, autonomy for Ireland within the United Kingdom, known as "Home Rule", was regarded as highly likely.
In response, opponents to Home Rule, from Conservative and Unionist Party leaders such as Andrew Bonar Law and Dublin-based barrister Sir Edward Carson to militant unionists in Ireland, threatened the use of violence.
Unionists were in a minority on the island of Ireland as a whole, but in the northern province of Ulster they were a very large majority in County Antrim and County Down, small majorities in County Armagh and County Londonderry and a substantial minority in the rest of the province.
Most of the remaining 26 counties which later became the Republic of Ireland were overwhelmingly majority-nationalist.
The war was expected to last only a few weeks but in fact lasted four years.
Public opinion in the majority "nationalist" community (who sought greater independence from Britain) had shifted during the war from a demand for home rule to one for full independence.
In 1919, David Lloyd George proposed a new bill which would divide Ireland into two Home Rule areas: twenty-six counties being ruled from Dublin and six being ruled from Belfast.
Straddling these two areas would be a shared Lord Lieutenant of Ireland who would appoint both governments and a Council of Ireland, which Lloyd George believed would evolve into an all-Ireland parliament.
Events had however overtaken the government.
Ireland was partitioned between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland in 1921 under the terms of Lloyd George's Government of Ireland Act 1920 during the Anglo-Irish War between Irish republican and British forces.
At the conclusion of that war on 6 December 1922, under the terms of the resulting treaty, Northern Ireland provisionally became an autonomous part of the newly independent Irish Free State, with the right to opt out of it.
===Northern Ireland===As expected, the Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland resolved on 7 December 1922 (the day after the establishment of the Irish Free State) to make the following address to the King to exercise, within the one month allowed, the right to opt out of the Irish Free State: "Most Gracious Sovereign, We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Senators and Commons of Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled, having learnt of the passing of the Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922, being the Act of Parliament for the ratification of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, do, by this humble Address, pray your Majesty that the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland".
Owing to the outbreak of civil war in the Free State, the work of the commission was delayed until 1925.
Leaders in Dublin expected a substantial reduction in the territory of Northern Ireland, with nationalist areas moving to the Free State.
In June 1940, to encourage the neutral Irish state to join with the Allies, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill indicated to the Taoiseach Éamon de Valera that the United Kingdom would push for Irish unity, but believing that Churchill could not deliver, de Valera declined the offer.
The British did not inform the Government of Northern Ireland that they had made the offer to the Dublin government, and De Valera's rejection was not publicised until 1970.
The Ireland Act 1949 gave the first legal guarantee that the region would not cease to be part of the United Kingdom without the consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.
However NICRA's campaign, and the reaction to it, proved to be a precursor to a more violent period.
Alongside the violence, there was a political deadlock between the major political parties in Northern Ireland, including those who condemned violence, over the future status of Northern Ireland and the form of government there should be within Northern Ireland.
In 1973, Northern Ireland held a referendum to determine if it should remain in the United Kingdom, or be part of a united Ireland.
The new Articles 2 and 3, added to the Constitution to replace the earlier articles, implicitly acknowledge that the status of Northern Ireland, and its relationships within the rest of the United Kingdom and with Ireland, would only be changed with the agreement of a majority of voters in both jurisdictions (Ireland voting separately).
At the same time, the British Government recognised for the first time, as part of the prospective, the so-called "Irish dimension": the principle that the people of the island of Ireland as a whole have the right, without any outside interference, to solve the issues between North and South by mutual consent.
These institutions were suspended by the British Government in 2002 after Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) allegations of spying by people working for Sinn Féin at the Assembly (Stormontgate).
On 28 July 2005, the Provisional IRA declared an end to its campaign and has since decommissioned what is thought to be all of its arsenal.
Politicians elected to the Assembly at the 2003 Assembly election were called together on 15 May 2006 under the Northern Ireland Act 2006 for the purpose of electing a First Minister of Northern Ireland and a deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland and choosing the members of an Executive (before 25 November 2006) as a preliminary step to the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland.
Following the election held on 7 March 2007, devolved government returned to Northern Ireland on 8 May 2007 with Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Ian Paisley and Sinn Féin deputy leader Martin McGuinness taking office as First Minister and deputy First Minister, respectively.
==Politics=====Background===The main political divide in Northern Ireland is between Unionists or Loyalists, who wish to see Northern Ireland continue as part of the United Kingdom, and Nationalists or Republicans, who wish to see Northern Ireland join the rest of Ireland, independent from the United Kingdom.
Some Unionists argue that any discrimination was not just due to religious or political bigotry, but also the result of more complex socio-economic, socio-political and geographical factors.
The political unrest went through its most violent phase between 1968 and 1994.
According to a 2009 opinion poll, 69% express longterm preference of the maintenance of Northern Ireland's membership of the United Kingdom (either directly ruled or with devolved government), while 21% express a preference for membership of a united Ireland.
This discrepancy can be explained by the overwhelming preference among Protestants to remain a part of the UK (91%), while Catholic preferences are spread across a number of solutions to the constitutional question including remaining a part of the UK (47%), a united Ireland (40%), Northern Ireland becoming an independent state (5%), and those who "don't know" (5%).
Official voting figures, which reflect views on the "national question" along with issues of candidate, geography, personal loyalty and historic voting patterns, show 54% of Northern Ireland voters vote for Pro-Unionist parties, 42% vote for Pro-Nationalist parties and 4% vote "other".
Most of the population of Northern Ireland are at least nominally Christian.
For the most part, Protestants feel a strong connection with Great Britain and wish for Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Many Catholics however, generally aspire to a United Ireland or are less certain about how to solve the constitutional question.
In the 2009 survey by Northern Ireland Life and Times, 47% of Northern Irish Catholics supported Northern Ireland remaining a part of the United Kingdom, either by direct rule (8%) or devolved government (39%).
Protestants have a slight majority in Northern Ireland, according to the latest Northern Ireland Census.
The make-up of the Northern Ireland Assembly reflects the appeals of the various parties within the population.
===Governance===Since 1998, Northern Ireland has devolved government within the United Kingdom.
Reserved matters are a list of policy area (such as civil aviation, units of measurement, and human genetics), which Parliament may devolve to Northern Ireland Assembly at some time in future.
On all other matters, the Northern Ireland Executive together with the 108-member Northern Ireland Assembly may legislate and govern for Northern Ireland.
Devolution in Northern Ireland is dependent upon participation by members of the Northern Ireland executive in the North/South Ministerial Council, which co-ordinates areas of co-operation (such as agriculture, education and health) between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
Elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly are by single transferable vote with six representatives (Member of the Legislative Assembly, MLAs) elected from 18 parliamentary constituencies.
However, not all of these take their seats.
Northern Ireland itself forms a single constituency for elections to the European Union.
Northern Ireland law developed from Irish law that existed before the partition of Ireland in 1921.
Northern Ireland is a common law jurisdiction and its common law is similar to that in England and Wales.
However, there are some important differences in law and procedure between Northern Ireland and England and Wales.
The body of statute law affecting Northern Ireland reflects the history of Northern Ireland, including Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the former Parliament of Northern Ireland and the Parliament of Ireland, along with some Acts of the Parliament of England and of the Parliament of Great Britain that were extended to Ireland under Poynings' Law between 1494 and 1782.
This does not however account for the complex identities within Northern Ireland, given that many of the population regard themselves as "Ulster" or "Northern Irish", either as a primary or secondary identity.
Compared to a similar survey carried out in 1998, this shows a fall in the percentage of Protestants identifying as British and Ulster, and a rise in those identifying as Northern Irish.
The 2008 survey found that 61% of Catholics described themselves as Irish, with 25% identifying as Northern Irish, 8% as British and 1% as Ulster.
People born in Northern Ireland are, with some exceptions, deemed by UK law to be citizens of the United Kingdom.
They are also, with similar exceptions, entitled to be citizens of Ireland.
Both governments exclude some people born in Northern Ireland, in particular persons born without one parent who is a British or Irish citizen.
The position in UK nationality law is that most of those born in Northern Ireland are UK nationals, whether or not they so choose.
The centrepiece of Northern Ireland's geography is Lough Neagh, at the largest freshwater lake both on the island of Ireland and in the British Isles.
A second extensive lake system is centred on Lower and Upper Lough Erne in Fermanagh.
The largest island of Northern Ireland is Rathlin, off the north Antrim coast.
None of the hills are especially high, with Slieve Donard in the dramatic Mournes reaching , Northern Ireland's highest point.
Also in north Antrim are the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge, Mussenden Temple and the Glens of Antrim.
The Lower and Upper River Bann, River Foyle and River Blackwater form extensive fertile lowlands, with excellent arable land also found in North and East Down, although much of the hill country is marginal and suitable largely for animal husbandry.
The weather is unpredictable at all times of the year, and although the seasons are distinct, they are considerably less pronounced than in interior Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America.
The damp climate and extensive deforestation in the 16th and 17th centuries resulted in much of the region being covered in rich green grassland.
These counties are no longer used for local government purposes; instead there are twenty-six districts of Northern Ireland which have different geographical extents, even in the case of those named after the counties from which they derive their name.
Fermanagh District Council most closely follows the borders of the county from which it takes its name.
Most districts are based around large towns, for instance Coleraine Borough Council derives its name from the town of Coleraine in County Londonderry.
Although counties are no longer used for governmental purpose, they remain a popular means of describing where places are.
The name of county then appears in both Irish and English on the passport's information page, as opposed to the town or city of birth on the United Kingdom passport.
The original system of car registration numbers largely based on counties still remains in use.
The Union Jack and the former Northern Ireland flag are flown in some loyalist areas, and the Tricolour, adopted by republicans as the flag of Ireland in 1916, is flown in some republican areas.
The official flag is that of the state having sovereignty over the territory, i.e.
The former Northern Ireland flag, also known as the "Ulster Banner" or "Red Hand Flag", is a banner derived from the coat of arms of the Government of Northern Ireland until 1972.
Since 1972, it has had no official status.
This red saltire on a white field was used to represent Ireland in the flag of the United Kingdom.
It is still used by some British army regiments.
Foreign flags are also found, such as the Palestinian flags in some Nationalist areas and Israeli flags in some Unionist areas.
The United Kingdom national anthem of "God Save the Queen" is often played at state events in Northern Ireland.
Major Gaelic Athletic Association matches are opened by the Irish national anthem, "Amhrán na bhFiann (The Soldier's Song)", which is also used by most other all-Ireland sporting organisations.
The Irish national anthem is also played at Dublin home matches, being the anthem of the host country.
The division in nomenclature is sometimes seen in the names of organisations associated with one or other of the main communities, but there are numerous exceptions.
In Gaelic games, followed mainly by nationalists, the GAA county is "Derry", but in sports followed mainly by unionists, clubs tend to avoid the use of "Londonderry" in favour of more precise locales (Glendermott Cricket Club) or neutral terms (Foyle Hockey Club).
"Derry" is also used in the names of both the Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic dioceses, and by one of the largest Protestant fraternal societies, the Apprentice Boys of Derry.
There is no agreement on how to decide on a name.
The Queen has not intervened on the matter and thus the council is now called the Derry City Council while the city is still officially Londonderry.
The choice of term can be controversial and can reveal the writer's political preferences.
This has been noted as a problem by several writers on Northern Ireland, with no generally recommended solution.
There is also no uniform or guiding way to refer to Northern Ireland amongst the agencies of the UK government.
For example, the websites of the Office of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the UK Statistics Authority describe the United Kingdom as being made up of four countries, one of these being Northern Ireland.
Other pages on the same websites refer to Northern Ireland specifically as a "province" as do publications of the UK Statistics Authority.
The website of the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency also refers to Northern Ireland as being a province as does the website of the Office of Public Sector Information and other agencies within Northern Ireland.
Publications of HM Treasury and the Department of Finance and Personnel of the Northern Ireland Executive, on the other hand, describe Northern Ireland as being a "region of the UK".
The UK's submission to the 2007 United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names defines the UK as being made up of two countries (England and Scotland), one principality (Wales) and one province (Northern Ireland).
Unlike England, Scotland and Wales, Northern Ireland has no history of being an independent country or of being a nation in its own right.
Some writers describe the United Kingdom as being made up of three countries and one province or point out the difficulties with calling Northern Ireland a country.
Even for the period covering the first 50 years of Northern Ireland's existence, the term "country" is considered inappropriate by some political scientists on the basis that many decisions were still made in London.
Major sea ports at Larne and Belfast carry passengers and freight between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
European route E01 runs from Larne through the island of Ireland, Spain and Portugal to Seville.
The population in 2011 was 1.8 million, having grown 7.5% over the previous decade from just under 1.7 million in 2001.
This constitutes just under 3% of the population of the UK (62 million) and just over 28% of the population of the island of Ireland (6.3 million).
In 2011, 88.8% of the population were born in Northern Ireland, with 4.5% born in other parts of the United Kingdom, and 2.9% born in the Republic of Ireland.
Black people of various origins made up 0.2% of the 2011 population and people of mixed ethnicity made up 0.2%.
The largest single denomination is the Roman Catholic Church, to which 41% of the population belonged.
It is the "de facto" official language and the Administration of Justice (Language) Act (Ireland) 1737 prohibits the use of languages other than English in legal proceedings.
These operate separately under the aegis of the North/South Language Body, which reports to the North/South Ministerial Council.
The British government in 2001 ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.
Irish (in Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, with a range of specific undertakings in relation to education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities and other matters.
A lower level of recognition was accorded to Ulster Scots, under Part II of the Charter.
====English====The dialect of English spoken in Northern Ireland shows influence from the lowland Scots language.
However, geography is a much more important determinant of dialect than religious background.
It was spoken predominantly throughout what is now Northern Ireland before the Ulster Plantations in the 17th century and most place names in Northern Ireland are anglicised versions of a Gaelic name.
Today, the language is associated with Irish nationalism (and thus with the Catholic community).
However, in the 19th century, the language was seen as a common heritage, with Ulster Protestants playing a leading role in the Gaelic revival.
In another survey, from 1999, 1% of respondents said they spoke it as their main language at home.
The dialect spoken in Northern Ireland, Ulster Irish or Donegal Irish, is the one closest to Scottish Gaelic (which developed into a separate language from Irish Gaelic in the 17th century).
Some words and phrases are shared with Scots Gaelic, and the dialects of east Ulster – those of Rathlin Island and the Glens of Antrim – were very similar to the dialect of Argyll, the part of Scotland nearest to Northern Ireland.
Approximately 2% of the population claim to speak Ulster Scots.
====Sign languages====The most common sign language in Northern Ireland is Northern Ireland Sign Language (NISL).
Irish Sign Language (ISL) has some influence from the French family of sign language, which includes American Sign Language (ASL).
NISL takes a large component from the British family of sign language (which also includes Auslan) with many borrowings from ASL.
It is described as being related to Irish Sign Language at the syntactic level while much of the lexicon is based on British Sign Language (BSL) and American Sign Language.
Since 1987 public houses have been allowed to open on Sundays, despite some opposition.
This is one of the four major cycles of Irish mythology.
The cycle centres on the reign of Conchobar mac Nessa, who is said to have been king of Ulster around the 1st century.
He ruled from Emain Macha (now Navan Fort near Armagh), and had a fierce rivalry with queen Medb and king Ailill of Connacht and their ally, Fergus mac Róich, former king of Ulster.
The foremost hero of the cycle is Conchobar's nephew Cúchulainn.
==Sport==In Northern Ireland, sport is popular and important in the lives of many people.
Sports tend to be organised on an all-Ireland basis and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland often field a single team.
However, the best Northern Irish players tend to play for clubs in the English or Scottish leagues.
Despite Northern Ireland's small population, its international team qualified for the World Cup in 1958, 1982 and 1986, making it to the quarter-finals in 1958 and 1982.
Ulster is one of the four professional provincial teams in Ireland and competes in the Celtic League and European Cup and won the European Cup in 1999.
In international competitions, the Ireland national rugby team recent successes include four Triple Crowns between 2004 and 2009 and a Grand Slam in 2009 in the Six Nations Championship.
====Cricket====The Ireland cricket team is an associate member of the International Cricket Council.
It participated in 2007 Cricket World Cup and qualified for the Super 8s and did the same in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20.
One of Ireland's regular international venues is Stormont in Belfast.
Of the four, football is the most popular in Northern Ireland.
The Ulster GAA is the branch of the Gaelic Athletic Association that is responsible for the nine counties of Ulster, which include the six of Northern Ireland.
Northern Ireland has contributed more major champions in the modern era than any other European country, with three in the space of just 14 months from the US Open in 2010 to the Open Championship in 2011. Notable golfers include Fred Daly (winner of The Open in 1947), Ryder Cup players Ronan Rafferty and David Feherty, leading European Tour professionals David Jones, Michael Hoey (a winner on Tour in 2011) and Gareth Maybin, as well as three recent major winners Graeme McDowell (winner of the US Open in 2010, the first European to do so since 1970), Rory McIlroy (winner of two majors) and Darren Clarke (winner of The Open in 2011).
Northern Ireland has also contributed several players to the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, including Alan Dunbar and Paul Cutler who played on the victorious 2011 team in Scotland.
Northern Ireland's golf courses include the Royal Belfast Golf Club (the earliest, formed in 1881), Royal Portrush Golf Club, which is the only course outside Great Britain to have hosted The Open Championship, and Royal County Down Golf Club ("Golf Digest" magazine's top-rated course outside the United States).
===Snooker===Northern Ireland has produced two world snooker champions; Alex Higgins, who won the title in 1972 and 1982, and Dennis Taylor, who won in 1985.
The highest-ranked Northern Ireland professional on the world circuit presently is Mark Allen from Antrim.
RTÉ, the national broadcaster of the Republic of Ireland, is available over the air to most parts of Northern Ireland via reception overspill and via satellite and cable.
As well as the standard UK-wide radio stations from the BBC, Northern Ireland is home to many local radio stations, such as Cool FM, CityBeat, and Q102.9.
People in Northern Ireland who live close to the border with the Republic of Ireland may inadvertently switch over to the Irish mobile networks, causing international roaming fees to be applied.
Northern Ireland can be called from the Republic of Ireland at trunk rates, as opposed to international rates, using the 048 prefix.

These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history.
Wales is mostly mountainous, though South Wales is less mountainous than North and mid Wales.
The main population and industrial areas are in South Wales, consisting of the coastal cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, and the South Wales Valleys to their north.
The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia and include Snowdon () which, at , is the highest peak in Wales.
The 14, or possibly 15, Welsh mountains over 3,000 feet (914 m) high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s.
The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard in the Mourne Mountains at .
Summers are warmest in the south-east of England, being closest to the European mainland, and coolest in the north.
Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground, and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills.
Until the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements, but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function.
Change did not occur in a uniform manner and the devolution of power over local government to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland means that future changes are also unlikely to be uniform.
The organisation of local government in England is complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to local arrangements.
Legislation concerning local government in England is the responsibility of the UK parliament and the Government of the United Kingdom, as England has no devolved parliament.
The upper-tier subdivisions of England are the nine Government office regions or European Union government office regions.
One region, Greater London, has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a referendum.
For local government purposes, Scotland is divided into 32 council areas, with wide variation in both size and population.
The representative association of Scotland's local authorities is the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA).
Local government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities.
The Welsh Local Government Association represents the interests of local authorities in Wales.
On 13 March 2008 the executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils and replace the present system.
They are the remnants of the British Empire and several have specifically voted to remain British territories (Bermuda in 1995, Gibraltar in 2002 and the Falkland Islands in 2013).
Executive power is exercised by the prime minister and cabinet, all of whom are sworn into the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, and become Ministers of the Crown.
The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 require that a new election must be called no later than five years after the previous general election.
England, the largest country of the United Kingdom, has no such devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the UK government and parliament on all issues.
The Scottish Government and Parliament have wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the UK parliament, including education, healthcare, Scots law and local government.
At the 2011 elections the Scottish National Party won re-election and achieved an overall majority in the Scottish parliament, with its leader, Alex Salmond, as First Minister of Scotland.
The Welsh Government and the National Assembly for Wales have more limited powers than those devolved to Scotland.
The 2011 elections resulted in a minority Labour administration led by Carwyn Jones.
Currently, Peter Robinson (Democratic Unionist Party) and Martin McGuinness (Sinn Féin) are First Minister and deputy First Minister respectively.
The UK does not have a codified constitution and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
Under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, the UK Parliament could, in theory, therefore, abolish the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly.
Today the UK has three distinct systems of law: English law, Northern Ireland law and Scots law.
A new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom came into being in October 2009 to replace the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords.
The chief courts are the Court of Session, for civil cases, and the High Court of Justiciary, for criminal cases.
The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law.
Sheriff courts deal with most civil and criminal cases including conducting criminal trials with a jury, known as sheriff solemn court, or with a sheriff and no jury, known as sheriff summary Court.
Crime in England and Wales increased in the period between 1981 and 1995, though since that peak there has been an overall fall of 48% in recorded crime from 1995 to 2007/08, according to crime statistics.
The prison population of England and Wales has almost doubled over the same period, to over 80,000, giving England and Wales the highest rate of incarceration in Western Europe at 147 per 100,000.
Crime in Scotland fell to its lowest recorded level for 32 years in 2009/10, falling by ten per cent.
At the same time Scotland's prison population, at over 8,000, is at record levels and well above design capacity.
===Foreign relations===The UK is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a member of NATO, the Commonwealth of Nations, G7, G8, G20, the OECD, the WTO, the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and is a member state of the European Union.
The last time the British military fought alone was the Falklands War of 1982.
In the final quarter of 2008 the UK economy officially entered recession for the first time since 1991.
Unemployment increased from 5.2% in May 2008 to 7.6% in May 2009 and by January 2012 the unemployment rate among 18 to 24-year-olds had risen from 11.9% to 22.5%, the highest since current records began in 1992.
The poverty line in the UK is commonly defined as being 60% of the median household income.
This is a higher level of relative poverty than all but four other EU members.
In the same year 4.0 million children, 31% of the total, lived in households below the poverty line after housing costs were taken into account.
This is a decrease of 400,000 children since 1998–1999.
The UK imports 40% of its food supplies.
Major theorists from the 17th and 18th centuries include Isaac Newton, whose laws of motion and illumination of gravity have been seen as a keystone of modern science; from the 19th century Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by natural selection was fundamental to the development of modern biology, and James Clerk Maxwell, who formulated classical electromagnetic theory; and more recently Stephen Hawking, who has advanced major theories in the fields of cosmology, quantum gravity and the investigation of black holes.
Major scientific discoveries from the 18th century include hydrogen by Henry Cavendish; from the 20th century penicillin by Alexander Fleming, and the structure of DNA, by Francis Crick and others.
Major engineering projects and applications by people from the UK in the 18th century include the steam locomotive, developed by Richard Trevithick and Andrew Vivian; from the 19th century the electric motor by Michael Faraday, the incandescent light bulb by Joseph Swan, and the first practical telephone, patented by Alexander Graham Bell; and in the 20th century the world's first working television system by John Logie Baird and others, the jet engine by Frank Whittle, the basis of the modern computer by Alan Turing, and the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee.
Scientific research and development remains important in British universities, with many establishing science parks to facilitate production and co-operation with industry.
Between 2004 and 2008 the UK produced 7% of the world's scientific research papers and had an 8% share of scientific citations, the third and second highest in the world (after the United States and China, and the United States, respectively).
In the year from October 2009 to September 2010 UK airports handled a total of 211.4 million passengers.
In that period the three largest airports were London Heathrow Airport (65.6 million passengers), Gatwick Airport (31.5 million passengers) and London Stansted Airport (18.9 million passengers).
London Heathrow Airport, located west of the capital, has the most international passenger traffic of any airport in the world and is the hub for the UK flag carrier British Airways, as well as for BMI and Virgin Atlantic.
===Energy===In 2006, the UK was the world's ninth-largest consumer of energy and the 15th-largest producer.
In 2009, the UK produced 1.5 million barrels per day (bbl/d) of oil and consumed 1.7 million bbl/d.
In 2009, the UK was the 13th-largest producer of natural gas in the world and the largest producer in the EU.
Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of natural gas since 2004.
In 2005 it had proven recoverable coal reserves of 171 million tons.
==Demographics==A census is taken simultaneously in all parts of the UK every ten years.
The Office for National Statistics is responsible for collecting data for England and Wales, the General Register Office for Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency each being responsible for censuses in their respective countries.
2010 was the third successive year in which natural change contributed more to population growth than net long-term international migration.
This compares to 0.3% per year in the period 1991 to 2001 and 0.2% in the decade 1981 to 1991.
It has been estimated that the number of people aged 100 or over will rise steeply to reach over 626,000 by 2080.
It is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with 383 people resident per square kilometre in mid-2003, with a particular concentration in London and the south-east.
In 2012 the average total fertility rate (TFR) across the UK was 1.92 children per woman.
While a rising birth rate is contributing to current population growth, it remains considerably below the 'baby boom' peak of 2.95 children per woman in 1964, below the replacement rate of 2.1, but higher than the 2001 record low of 1.63.
In 2012, Scotland had the lowest TFR at only 1.67, followed by Wales at 1.88, England at 1.94, and Northern Ireland at 2.03.
===Ethnic groups===Historically, indigenous British people were thought to be descended from the various ethnic groups that settled there before the 11th century: the Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Norse and the Normans.
Welsh people could be the oldest ethnic group in the UK.
The UK has a history of small-scale non-white immigration, with Liverpool having the oldest Black population in the country dating back to at least the 1730s during the period of the African slave trade, and the oldest Chinese community in Europe, dating to the arrival of Chinese seamen in the 19th century.
In 1950 there were probably fewer than 20,000 non-white residents in Britain, almost all born overseas.
Since 1948 substantial immigration from Africa, the Caribbean and South Asia has been a legacy of ties forged by the British Empire.
30.4% of London's population and 37.4% of Leicester's was estimated to be non-white , whereas less than 5% of the populations of North East England, Wales and the South West were from ethnic minorities, according to the 2001 census.
, 26.5% of primary and 22.2% of secondary pupils at state schools in England were members of an ethnic minority.
In the 2001 Census over a fifth (21%) of the population of Wales said they could speak Welsh, an increase from the 1991 Census (18%).
In addition it is estimated that about 200,000 Welsh speakers live in England.
In the same census in Northern Ireland 167,487 people (10.4%) stated that they had "some knowledge of Irish" (see Irish language in Northern Ireland), almost exclusively in the nationalist (mainly Catholic) population.
Over 92,000 people in Scotland (just under 2% of the population) had some Gaelic language ability, including 72% of those living in the Outer Hebrides.
It is compulsory for pupils to study a second language up to the age of 14 in England, and up to age 16 in Scotland.
French and German are the two most commonly taught second languages in England and Scotland.
All pupils in Wales are taught Welsh as a second language up to age 16, or are taught in Welsh.
The Church of England is the established church in England.
Unable to return to Poland at the end of World War II, over 120,000 Polish veterans remained in the UK permanently.
Many of these migrants came from the Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent.
In 2010, there were 7.0 million foreign-born residents in the UK, corresponding to 11.3% of the total population.
Analysis of Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows that a net total of 2.3 million migrants moved to the UK in the 15 years from 1991 to 2006.
A record 241,192 people were granted permanent settlement rights in 2010, of whom 51% were from Asia and 27% from Africa.
25.5% of babies born in England and Wales in 2011 were born to mothers born outside the UK, according to official statistics released in 2012.
Citizens of the European Union, including those of the UK, have the right to live and work in any EU member state.
The UK applied temporary restrictions to citizens of Romania and Bulgaria, which joined the EU in January 2007.
Research conducted by the Migration Policy Institute for the Equality and Human Rights Commission suggests that, between May 2004 and September 2009, 1.5 million workers migrated from the new EU member states to the UK, two-thirds of them Polish, but that many subsequently returned home, resulting in a net increase in the number of nationals of the new member states in the UK of some 700,000 over that period.
The late-2000s recession in the UK reduced the economic incentive for Poles to migrate to the UK, the migration becoming temporary and circular.
In 2009, for the first time since enlargement, more nationals of the eight central and eastern European states that had joined the EU in 2004 left the UK than arrived.
In 2011, citizens of the new EU member states made up 13% of the immigrants entering the country.
The UK government has introduced a points-based immigration system for immigration from outside the European Economic Area to replace former schemes, including the Scottish Government's Fresh Talent Initiative.
In June 2010 the UK government introduced a temporary limit of 24,000 on immigration from outside the EU, aiming to discourage applications before a permanent cap was imposed in April 2011.
===Education===Education in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter, with each country having a separate education system.
Whilst education in England is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Education, the day-to-day administration and funding of state schools is the responsibility of local authorities.
Education is now mandatory from ages five to sixteen (15 if born in late July or August).
The majority of children are educated in state-sector schools, a small proportion of which select on the grounds of academic ability.
Despite a fall in actual numbers the proportion of children in England attending private schools has risen to over 7%.
Education in Scotland is the responsibility of the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, with day-to-day administration and funding of state schools the responsibility of Local Authorities.
Scotland first legislated for compulsory education in 1496.
The proportion of children in Scotland attending private schools is just over 4%, and it has been rising slowly in recent years.
The Welsh Government has responsibility for education in Wales.

===Healthcare===Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter and each country has its own system of private and publicly funded health care, together with alternative, holistic and complementary treatments.
Public healthcare is provided to all UK permanent residents and is mostly free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation.
The World Health Organization, in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth best in Europe and eighteenth in the world.
Regulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the General Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Council and non-governmental-based, such as the Royal Colleges.
However, political and operational responsibility for healthcare lies with four national executives; healthcare in England is the responsibility of the UK Government; healthcare in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive; healthcare in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Government; and healthcare in Wales is the responsibility of the Welsh Assembly Government.
Each National Health Service has different policies and priorities, resulting in contrasts.
Since 1979 expenditure on healthcare has been increased significantly to bring it closer to the European Union average.
The UK spends around 8.4% of its gross domestic product on healthcare, which is 0.5 percentage points below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average and about one percentage point below the average of the European Union.
==Culture==The culture of the United Kingdom has been influenced by many factors including: the nation's island status; its history as a western liberal democracy and a major power; as well as being a political union of four countries with each preserving elements of distinctive traditions, customs and symbolism.

In 1871 Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, and in 1946 that of the Italian Republic.
In 2011, Rome was the 18th-most-visited city in the world, 3rd most visited in the European Union, and the most popular tourist attraction in Italy.
Its historic centre is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.
However, the power of the well known tale of Rome's legendary foundation tends to deflect attention from its actual, and much more ancient, origins.
However, under these extravagant and rich popes, Rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture.
Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.
In this twenty-year period, Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world.
Its economy was rich, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including Agostino Chigi, who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts.
The fight between France and Spain in Europe caused the first plunder of the city in more than one thousand years.
Beginning with the Council of Trent in 1545, the Church began the Counter-Reformation as an answer to the Reformation, a large-scale questioning of the Church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs.
(This loss of confidence then led to major shifts of power away from the Church.
After the fall of Napoleon, the Church State under the pope was reinstated through the Congress of Vienna of 1814.
In 1849 another Roman Republic arose within the framework of the revolutions of 1848.
Rome then became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification, as the rest of Italy was reunited as the Kingdom of Italy, with a temporary capital at Florence.
In 1861 Rome was declared capital of Italy even though it was still under the control of the Pope.
And it was only when this was lifted in 1870, owing to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, that Italian troops were able to capture Rome entering the city through a breach near Porta Pia.
Afterwards, Pope Pius IX declared himself as prisoner in the Vatican, and in 1871 the capital of Italy was finally moved from Florence to Rome.
Soon after World War I, Rome witnessed the rise to power of Italian Fascism, led by Benito Mussolini, who marched on the city in 1922, eventually declaring a new Italian Empire and allying Italy with Nazi Germany.
The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city's population, which surpassed one million inhabitants.
The rising trend in population growth continued until the mid-1980s, when the "comune" had more than 2.8 million residents; after that, population started to decline slowly as inhabitants began to move to nearby suburbs of Rome.
A new subdivision of the city under Napoleon was ephemeral, and there were no sensible changes in the organisation of the city until 1870, when Rome became the third capital of Italy.
At the beginning of the 20th century other rioni where created (the last one was Prati – the only one outside the Walls of Pope Urban VIII – in 1921).
The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the Tiber Island, the only natural ford of the river in this area.
Modern Rome is also crossed by another river, the Aniene, which flows into the Tiber north of the historic centre.
The altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from above sea level (at the base of the Pantheon) to above sea level (the peak of Monte Mario).
Rome outgrew the Servian Wall, but no more walls were constructed until almost 700 years later, when, in 270 AD, Emperor Aurelian began building the Aurelian Walls.
These were almost long, and were still the walls the troops of the Kingdom of Italy had to breach to enter the city in 1870.
In the coldest month – January, the average temperature is during the day and at night.
The average relative humidity is 75%, varying from 72% in July to 77% in November.
At the time of the Emperor Augustus, Rome was the largest city in the world: with a population of about one million people (about the size of London in the early 19th century, when London was the largest city in the world).
The Fascist regime of Mussolini tried to block an excessive demographic rise of the city, but failed to prevent it from reaching one million people by the early 1930s.
After the Second World War, growth continued, helped by a post-war economic boom.
In mid-2010, there were 2,754,440 residents in the city proper, while some 4.2 million people lived in the greater Rome area (which can be approximately identified with its administrative metropolitan city, with a population density of about 800inhab./km2 stretching over more than 5,000 km²).
Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 17.00 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 20.76 percent.
This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners).
The average age of a Roman resident is 43 compared to the Italian average of 42.
In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Rome grew by 6.54 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent.
The current birth rate of Rome is 9.10 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.
Despite some interruptions (such as the Avignon papacy), Rome has for centuries been the home of the Roman Catholic Church and the Bishop of Rome, otherwise known as the Pope.
The area was part of the Roman rione of Borgo until 1929.
*1822 – The Florida Territory is created in the United States.

Mongolia (Mongolian: , "" and , "Mongol Uls") is a landlocked country in east-central Asia.
Ulaanbaatar, the capital and also the largest city, is home to about 45% of the population.
Mongolia's political system is a parliamentary republic.
The area of what is now Mongolia has been ruled by various nomadic empires, including the Xiongnu, the Xianbei, the Rouran, the Turkic Khaganate, and others.
After the breakdown of communist regimes in Europe in late 1989, Mongolia saw its own peaceful democratic revolution in early 1990; it led to a multi-party system, a new constitution of 1992, and transition to a market economy.
Mongolia joined the World Trade Organization in 1997 and seeks to expand its participation in regional economic and trade regimes.
But the U.S. Department of State Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs uses the United Nations (UN) estimations instead of the U.S. Census Bureau estimations.
Mongolia's population growth rate is estimated at 1.2% (2007 est.).
About 59% of the total population is under age 30, 27% of whom are under 14.
This relatively young and growing population has placed strains on Mongolia's economy.
Since the end of socialism, Mongolia has experienced a decline of total fertility rate (children per woman) that is steeper than in any other country in the world, according to recent UN estimations: in 1970–1975, fertility was estimated to be 7.33 children per woman, dropping to about 2.1 in 2000–2005.
Recently, however, that trend has been stopped, so in 2005–2010 period, the estimated fertility value has actually increased to 2.5 and stabilised afterwards at the rate of about 2.2–2.3 children per woman.
Ethnic Mongols account for about 95% of the population and consist of Khalkha and other groups, all distinguished primarily by dialects of the Mongol language.
The Khalkha make up 86% of the ethnic Mongol population.
=== Languages ===The official language of Mongolia is Mongolian, and is spoken by 95% of the population.
A variety of dialects of Oirat and Buryat are spoken across the country, and there are also some speakers of Mongolic Khamnigan.
In the west of the country, Kazakh and Tuvan, both Turkic languages, are also spoken.
Today, Mongolian is written using the Cyrillic alphabet, although in the past it was written using the Mongolian script.
An official reintroduction of the old script was planned for 1994, but has not taken place as older generations encountered practical difficulties.
The traditional alphabet is being slowly reintroduced through schools.
A number of older educated Mongolian citizens speak some German, as they studied in the former East Germany, while a few speak other languages from the former Eastern Bloc.
Many younger people are fluent in the Western European languages as they study or work in, among other places, Germany, France and Italy.
Besides mining (21.8% of GDP) and agriculture (16% of GDP), dominant industries in the composition of GDP are wholesale and retail trade and service, transportation and storage, and real estate activities.
The grey economy is estimated to be at least one-third the size of the official economy.
As of 2006, 68.4% of Mongolia's exports went to the PRC, and the PRC supplied 29.8% of Mongolia's imports.
Mongolia is ranked as lower middle income economy by the World Bank.
22.4% of the population lives on less than US$1.25 a day.
Despite growth, the proportion of the population below the poverty line was estimated to be 35.6% in 1998, 36.1% in 2002–2003, 32.2% in 2006.
Because of a boom in the mining sector, Mongolia had high growth rates in 2007 and 2008 (9.9% and 8.9%, respectively).
In 2009, sharp drops in commodity prices and the effects of the global financial crisis caused the local currency to drop 40% against the U.S. dollar.
However, inflation continued to erode GDP gains, with an average rate of 12.6% expected in Mongolia at the end of 2011.
Mongolia made a significant improvement on the ease of doing business in 2012, moving up to rank 76 compared with 88 last year in the "Doing Business" report by the International Finance Corporation (IFC).
Mining is continuing to rise as a major industry of Mongolia as evidenced by number of Chinese, Russian and Canadian firms starting mining business in Mongolia.
In summer 2009, the government negotiated an "Investment Agreement" with Rio Tinto and Ivanhoe Mines to develop the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold deposit, the biggest foreign-investment project in Mongolia, expected to account for one-third of Mongolia's GDP by 2020.
In March 2011, six big mining companies prepared to bid for the Tavan Tolgoi area, the world's largest untapped coal deposit.
According to Erdenes MGL, the government body in-charge of Tavan Tolgoi, ArcelorMittal, Vale, Xstrata, U.S. coal miner Peabody, a consortium of Chinese energy firm Shenhua and Japan's Mitsui &amp; Co, and a separate consortium of Japanese, South Korean and Russian firms are the preferred bidders.
=== Agriculture ===In 2002, about 30% of all households in Mongolia lived from breeding livestock.
Most herders in Mongolia follow a pattern of nomadic or semi-nomadic pastoralism.
Due to the severe 2009–2010 winter, Mongolia lost 9.7 million animals, or 22% of total livestock.
This immediately affected meat prices, which increased twofold; GDP dropped 1.6% in 2009.
In the past it was known by the Russian term "yurt", but this is changing as the Mongolian term becomes better known among English-speaking countries.
According to Mongolian artist and art critic N. Chultem, the "ger" was the basis for development of traditional Mongolian architecture.
In the 16th and 17th centuries, lamaseries were built throughout the country.
Many of them started as "ger"-temples.
Further enlargement led to a quadratic shape of the temples.
Chultem distinguished three styles in traditional Mongolian architecture: Mongolian, Tibetan and Chinese as well as combinations of the three.
The temple Lavrin (18th century) in the Erdene Zuu lamasery was built in the Tibetan tradition.
An example of a temple built in the Chinese tradition is the lamasery Choijing Lamiin Sume (1904), which is a museum today.
The temple of Maitreya (disassembled in 1938) is an example of the Tibeto-Mongolian architecture.
The traditional music includes a variety of instruments, famously the morin khuur, and also the singing styles like the urtyn duu ("long song"), and throat-singing (khoomei).
The "tsam" is danced to keep away evil spirits and it was seen the reminiscences of shamaning.
The first rock band of Mongolia was Soyol Erdene, founded in the 1960s.
It was followed by Mungunhurhree, Ineemseglel, Urgoo, etc., carving out the path for the genre in the harsh environment of Communist ideology.
Mungunhurhree and Haranga were to become the pioneers in the Mongolia's heavy rock music.
Haranga approached its zenith in the late 1980s and 1990s.
The leader of Haranga, famous guitarist Enh-Manlai, generously helped the growth of the following generations of rockers.
Among the followers of Haranga was the band Hurd.
By that time, the environment for development of artistic thought had become largely liberal thanks to the new democratic society in the country.
The 1990s saw development of rap, techno, hip-hop and also boy bands and girl bands flourish at the turn of the millennium.
Until reforms in the 1990s, the government had strict control of the media and oversaw all publishing, in which no independent media was allowed.
The dissolution of the Soviet Union had a significant impact on Mongolia, where the one-party state grew into a multi-party democracy, and with that, media freedoms came to the forefront.
A new law on press freedom, drafted with help from international NGOs on August 28, 1998 and enacted on January 1, 1999, paved the way for media reforms.
The Mongolian media currently consists of around 300 print and broadcasting outlets.
Since 2006, the media environment has been improving with the government debating a new Freedom of Information Act, and the removal of any affiliation of media outlets with the government.
Market reforms have led to an increasing number of people working in the media year on year, along with students at journalism schools.
In its 2013 World Press Freedom Index report, Reporters Without Borders classified the media environment as 98th out of 179, with 1st being most free.
In modern-day Mongolia, Nadaam is held on July 11 to July 13 in the honour of the anniversaries of the National Democratic Revolution and foundation of the Great Mongol State.
Another very popular activity called Shagaa is the "flicking" of sheep ankle bones at a target several feet away, using a flicking motion of the finger to send the small bone flying at targets and trying to knock the target bones off the platform.
At Naadam, this contest is very popular and develops a serious audience among older Mongolians.
Horse riding is especially central to Mongolian culture.
The long-distance races that are showcased during Naadam festivals are one aspect of this, as is the popularity of trick riding.
One example of trick riding is the legend that the Mongolian military hero Damdin Sükhbaatar scattered coins on the ground and then picked them up while riding a horse at full gallop.
Mongolian wrestling is the most popular of all Mongol sports.
It is the highlight of the Three Manly Games of Naadam.
Hundreds of wrestlers from different cities and aimags around the country take part in the national wrestling competition.
Association football is also played in Mongolia.
The Mongolia Premier League is the top domestic competition.
Several Mongolian women have excelled in pistol shooting: Otryadyn Gündegmaa is a silver medalist of the 2008 Olympic Games, Munkhbayar Dorjsuren is a double world champion and Olympic bronze medal winner (now representing Germany), while Tsogbadrakhyn Mönkhzul is, as of May 2007, ranked third in the world in the 25 metre pistol event.
Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country by land area and the ninth largest country in the world; its territory of is larger than Western Europe.
Grain, potatoes, vegetables, melons and livestock are the most important agricultural commodities.
Chief livestock products are dairy products, leather, meat, and wool.
Wheat exports, a major source of hard currency, rank among the leading commodities in Kazakhstan's export trade.
In 2003 Kazakhstan harvested 17.6 million tons of grain in gross, 2.8% higher compared to 2002.
Kazakh agriculture still has many environmental problems from mismanagement during its years in the Soviet Union.
Some Kazakh wine is produced in the mountains to the east of Almaty.
Development of petroleum, natural gas, and mineral extractions, such as potassium, has attracted most of the over $40 billion in foreign investment in Kazakhstan since 1993 and accounts for some 57% of the nation's industrial output (or approximately 13% of gross domestic product).
According to some estimates, Kazakhstan has the second largest uranium, chromium, lead, and zinc reserves, the third largest manganese reserves, the fifth largest copper reserves, and ranks in the top ten for coal, iron, and gold.
It is also an exporter of diamonds.
Oil explorations have shown that the deposits on the Caspian shore are only a small part of a much larger deposit.
It is said that 3.5 billion tons of oil and 2.5 trillion cubic meters of gas could be found in that area.
Overall the estimate of Kazakhstan's oil deposits is 6.1 billion tons.
These are not capable of processing the total crude output so much of it is exported to Russia.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration Kazakhstan was producing approximately of oil per day in 2009.
===Banking===The banking industry of the Republic of Kazakhstan has experienced a pronounced boom and bust cycle over 2000s decade.
After several years of rapid expansion in the mid-2000s, the banking industry collapsed in 2008.
Although the Russian and Kazakh banking systems share several common features, there are also some fundamental differences.
Banks in Kazakhstan have experienced a lengthy period of political stability and economic growth.
Together with a rational approach to banking and finance policy, this has helped push Kazakhstan’s banking system to a higher level of development.
Banking technology and personnel qualifications alike are stronger in Kazakhstan than in Russia.
On the negative side, past stability in Kazakhstan arose from the concentration of virtually all political power in the hands of a single individual – the key factor in any assessment of system or country risk.
The potential is there for serious disturbances if and when authority passes into new hands.
Official estimates put the population of Kazakhstan at 16.455 million as of February 2011, of which 46% is rural and 54% is urban.
In 2013, Kazakhstan's population rose to 17,280,000 with a 1.7% growth rate over the past year according to the Kazakhstan Statistics Agency.
The 2009 population estimate is 6.8% higher than the population reported in the last census from January 1999.
The decline in population that began after 1989 has been arrested and possibly reversed.
Men and women make up 48.3% and 51.7% of the population, respectively.
Some minorities such as Germans (1.1%) (Germans who had previously settled in Russia, especially Volga Germans), Ukrainians, Koreans, Chechens, Meskhetian Turks, and Russian political opponents of the regime had been deported to Kazakhstan in the 1930s and 1940s by Stalin; some of the bigger Soviet labour camps (Gulag) existed in the country.
Significant Russian immigration also connected with Virgin Lands Campaign and Soviet space program during the Khrushchev era.
In 1989, ethnic Russians were 37.8% of the population and Kazakhs held a majority in only 7 of the 20 regions of the country.
Before 1991 there were one million Germans in Kazakhstan; most of them emigrated to Germany following the breakup of the Soviet Union.
Most members of the smaller Pontian Greek minority have emigrated to Greece.
In the late 1930s thousands of Koreans in the Soviet Union were deported to Central Asia.
These people are now known as Koryo-saram.
The 1990s were marked by the emigration of many of the country's Russians and Volga Germans, a process that began in the 1970s.
This has made indigenous Kazakhs the largest ethnic group.
Additional factors in the increase in the Kazakh population are higher birthrates and immigration of ethnic Kazakhs from China, Mongolia, and Russia.
Education across Kazakhstan is conducted in either Kazakh, Russian, or both.
===Religion===According to the 2009 Census, 70% of the population is Muslim, 26% Christian, 0.1% Buddhists, 0.2% others (mostly Jews), and 3% Irreligious, while 0.5% chose not to answer.
In November 2012, 183 members of the United Nations General Assembly elected Kazakhstan to serve a three-year term on the Human Rights Council, the United Nations key forum for tackling entrenched human rights concerns around the world.
In 2009, Kazakhstan published a National Human Rights Action Plan.
With support from the U.S. Department of State's Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL), the American Bar Association Rule of Law Initiative opened a media support center in Almaty to bolster free expression and journalistic rights in Kazakhstan.
==Rule of Law==ABA Rule of Law Initiative&lt;br&gt;The ABA Rule of Law Initiative (ABA ROLI) opened its first Kazakhstan office in the city of Almaty in 1993 and is currently based in Astana.
Since then, ABA ROLI has had offices in Shymkent and Oskemen.
Kazakhstan’s Supreme Court has taken recent steps to modernize and to increase transparency and oversight over the country’s legal system.
With funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development, the ABA Rule of Law Initiative began a new program in April 2012 to strengthen the independence and accountability of Kazakhstan’s judiciary.
The Procurator General of Kazakhstan and the Federal Bureau of Investigation collaborated in a complex seven-year investigation into an 11 February 2006 triple homicide of Altynbek Sarsenbayev, Baurzhan Baibosyn, and Vasiliy Zhuravlev.
The ranking American diplomat in Kazakhstan, Ambassador John Ordway, praised in a press conference the "exceptional cooperation between Kazakhstani and American law enforcement.
===Cuisine===In the national cuisine, livestock meat can be cooked in a variety of ways and is usually served with a wide assortment of traditional bread products.
A traditional Kazakh dinner involves a multitude of appetisers on the table, followed by a soup and one or two main courses such as pilaf and beshbarmak.
They also drink their national beverage, which consists of fermented mare's milk.
Kazakhstan is host of the International Astana Action Film Festival and the Eurasian Film Festival held annually.
Hollywood director Timur Bekmambetov is from Kazakhstan and has become active in bridging Hollywood to the Kazakhstan film industry.
(The national language, Kazakh, is related to the other Turkic languages, with which it shares cultural and historical ties.

Out of the abovementioned peaks, only Kazbek is of volcanic origin.
The region between Kazbek and Shkhara (a distance of about along the Main Caucasus Range) is dominated by numerous glaciers.
Out of the 2,100 glaciers that exist in the Caucasus today, approximately 30% are located within Georgia.
The Southern Georgia Volcanic Highland is a young and unstable geologic region with high seismic activity and has experienced some of the most significant earthquakes that have been recorded in Georgia.
The Krubera Cave is the deepest known cave in the world.
It is located in the Arabika Massif of the Gagra Range, in Abkhazia.
In October 2005, an unexplored part was found by the CAVEX team, further increasing the known depth of the cave.
Forests cover around 40% of Georgia's territory while the alpine/subalpine zone accounts for roughly around 10 percent of the land.
Much of the natural habitat in the low-lying areas of western Georgia has disappeared during the past 100 years because of the agricultural development of the land and urbanization.
In contrast with western Georgia, nearly 85 percent of the forests of the region are deciduous.
Coniferous forests only dominate in the Borjomi Gorge and in the extreme western areas.
The Upper Alazani River Valley contains yew forests.
The Lesser Caucasus Mountains partially protect the region from the influence of dry and hot air masses from the south as well.
Since the fall of the USSR in 1991, Georgia embarked on a major structural reform designed to transition to a free market economy.
The civil war and military conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia aggravated the crisis.
The first financial help from the West came in 1995, when the World Bank and International Monetary Fund granted Georgia a credit of USD 206 million and Germany granted DM 50 million.

"Georgia: A Political History Since Independence" (I.B.
Throughout its history, the kingdom of Armenia enjoyed both periods of independence and periods of autonomy subject to contemporary empires.
Christianity spread into the country as early as AD 40.
The Seljuk Empire soon started to collapse.
These events are traditionally commemorated yearly on 24 April, the Armenian Martyr Day, or the Day of the Armenian Genocide.
The situation was difficult for the church, which struggled under Soviet rule.
After the death of Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin took the reins of power and began an era of renewed fear and terror for Armenians.
Soon, life in Soviet Armenia began to see rapid improvement.
In 1967, a memorial to the victims of the Armenian Genocide was built at the Tsitsernakaberd hill above the Hrazdan gorge in Yerevan.
Compounding Armenia's problems was a devastating earthquake in 1988 with a moment magnitude of 7.2.
The violence resulted in the deaths of five Armenians killed in a shootout with the MVD at the railway station.
By the time both Azerbaijan and Armenia had finally agreed to a ceasefire in 1994, an estimated 30,000 people had been killed and over a million had been displaced.
Its relations with Europe, the Middle East, and the Commonwealth of Independent States have allowed Armenia to increase trade.
However, the low humidity level mitigates the effect of high temperatures.
Since 1999, Freedom House's Democracy Score for Armenia has been steadily on the decline (from 4.79 to 5.21).
Turkey also has a long history of poor relations with Armenia over its refusal to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide.
At the request of the Armenian government, Russia maintains a military base in the northwestern Armenian city of Gyumri as a deterrent against Turkey.
According to the US Census Bureau, there are 427,822 Armenians living in the country.
Armenia is also a member of the Council of Europe, maintaining friendly relations with the European Union, especially with its member states such as France and Greece.
The Armenian military was formed after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and with the establishment of the Ministry of Defence in 1992.
Armenian border guards are in charge of patrolling the country's borders with Georgia and Azerbaijan, while Russian troops continue to monitor its borders with Iran and Turkey.
The Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, which establishes comprehensive limits on key categories of military equipment, was ratified by the Armenian parliament in July 1992.
In March 1993, Armenia signed the multilateral Chemical Weapons Convention, which calls for the eventual elimination of chemical weapons.
Armenia also had 46 members of its military peacekeeping forces as a part of the Coalition Forces in Iraq War until October 2008.
Agriculture accounted for less than 20% of both net material product and total employment before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
After independence, the importance of agriculture in the economy increased markedly, its share at the end of the 1990s rising to more than 30% of GDP and more than 40% of total employment.
As the economic situation stabilized and growth resumed, the share of agriculture in GDP dropped to slightly over 20% (2006 data), although the share of agriculture in employment remained more than 40%.
In addition, the effects of the 1988 Spitak Earthquake, which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt.
Land routes through Georgia and Iran are inadequate or unreliable.
The national currency, the dram, suffered hyperinflation for the first years after its introduction in 1993.
Armenia has had strong economic growth since 1995, building on the turnaround that began the previous year, and inflation has been negligible for the past several years.
New sectors, such as precious-stone processing and jewellery making, information and communication technology, and even tourism are beginning to supplement more traditional sectors of the economy, such as agriculture.
These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit and stabilizing the currency; developing private businesses; energy; agriculture; food processing; transportation; the health and education sectors; and ongoing rehabilitation in the earthquake zone.
The government joined the World Trade Organization on 5 February 2003.
But one of the main sources of foreign direct investments remains the Armenian diaspora, which finances major parts of the reconstruction of infrastructure and other public projects.
Being a growing democratic state, Armenia also hopes to get more financial aid from the Western World.
A liberal foreign investment law was approved in June 1994, and a law on privatisation was adopted in 1997, as well as a program of state property privatisation.
However, unemployment, which currently stands at around 15%, still remains a major problem due to the influx of thousands of refugees from the Karabakh conflict.
In the 2007 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), Armenia ranked 99 of 179 countries.
In the 2008 Index of Economic Freedom, Armenia ranked 28th, ahead of countries like Austria, France, Portugal and Italy.
40,000 to 70,000 Armenians still live in Turkey (mostly in and around Istanbul).
===Health===Life expectancy at birth was at 70 for males and at 76 for females in 2006.
Government expenditure on health was at US$112 per person in 2006.
The Yazidi Kurds, who live in the western part of the country, practice Yazidism.
===Education===In its first years of independence, Armenia made uneven progress in establishing systems to meet its national requirements in social services.
Education, held in particular esteem in Armenian culture, changed fastest of the social services, while health and welfare services attempted to maintain the basic state-planned structure of the Soviet era.
In the communist era, Armenian education followed the standard Soviet model of complete state control (from Moscow) of curricula and teaching methods and close integration of education activities with other aspects of society, such as politics, culture, and the economy.
As in the Soviet period, primary and secondary education in Armenia is free, and completion of secondary school is compulsory.
In 1989 some 58% of Armenians over age fifteen had completed their secondary education, and 14% had a higher education.
Armenian became the dominant language of instruction, and many schools that had taught in Russian closed by the end of 1991.
Russian was still widely taught, however, as a second language.
The great doctor played the same role in Armenian Medical Science as Hippocrates in Western, Galen in Roman, Ibn Sīnā in Arabic medicine.
A great number of foreign students from India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, the USA and Russian Federation study together with Armenian students.
Nowadays the university is ranked among famous higher Medical Institutions and takes its honorable place in the World Directory of Medical Schools published by the WHO.
Armenia is also an active member of the international sports community, with full membership in the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF).
As part of the Soviet Union, Armenia was very successful, winning plenty of medals and helping the USSR win the medal standings at the Olympics on numerous occasions.
The government of Armenia budgets about $2.8 million annually for sports and gives it to the National Committee of Physical Education and Sports, the body that determines which programs should benefit from the funds.
Due to the lack of success lately on the international level, in recent years, Armenia has rebuilt 16 Soviet-era sports schools and furnished them with new equipment for a total cost of $1.9 million.
The rebuilding of the regional schools was financed by the Armenian government.
Nobel invented a detonator in 1863; and, in 1865, he designed the blasting cap.
Dynamite was patented in the US and the UK and was used extensively in mining and the building of transport networks internationally.
Nobel was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1884, the same institution that would later select laureates for two of the Nobel prizes, and he received an honorary doctorate from Uppsala University in 1893.
Nobel invested in these and amassed great wealth through the development of these new oil regions.
In 1891, following the death of his mother and his brother Ludvig and the end of a longstanding relationship, Nobel moved from Paris to San Remo, Italy.
Suffering from angina, Nobel died at home, of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1896.
He is buried in Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm.
Nobel travelled for much of his business life, maintaining companies in various countries in Europe and North America and keeping a permanent home in Paris from 1873 to 1891.
Though her personal contact with Alfred Nobel had been brief, she corresponded with him until his death in 1896, and it is believed that she was a major influence in his decision to include a peace prize among those prizes provided in his will.
The liaison lasted for 18 years.
Despite the lack of formal secondary and tertiary level education, Nobel gained proficiency in six languages: Swedish, French, Russian, English, German and Italian.
In 2010 it was published in Russia in another bilingual (Russian–Esperanto) edition.
Nobel demonstrated his explosive for the first time that year, at a quarry in Redhill, Surrey, England.
In 2012, the capital was worth around SEK 3.1 billion (USD 472 million, EUR 337 million), which is almost twice the amount of the initial capital, taking inflation into account.
This request added to the controversy over whether the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel is actually a "Nobel Prize".
==History==Hawaii is one of four states—apart from the original thirteen—that were independent prior to statehood—the Vermont Republic (1791), the Republic of Texas (1845), and the California Republic (1846)—and one of two, along with Texas, that had formal diplomatic recognition internationally.
Hawaii was an independent republic from 1894 until , when it officially became a territory of the United States.
Even though this report has been contested in later sources, it does explain some crucial aspects of Maldivian culture.
For instance, historically Arabic has been the prime language of administration there, instead of the Persian and Urdu languages used in the nearby Muslim states.
Another link to North Africa was the Maliki school of jurisprudence, used throughout most of North-Africa, which was the official one in the Maldives until the 17th century.
"===British protectorate, 1887–1965===On 16 December 1887, the Sultan of the Maldives signed a contract with the British Governor of Ceylon turning the Maldives into a British protected state, thus giving up the islands' sovereignty in matters of foreign policy, but retaining internal self-government.
The British government promised military protection and non-interference in local administration in exchange for an annual tribute, so that the islands were akin to an Indian princely state.
In November 2008, President Mohamed Nasheed announced plans to look into purchasing new land in India, Sri Lanka, and Australia because of his concerns about global warming, and the possibility of much of the islands being inundated with water from rising sea levels.
Today, the Maldives' largest industry is tourism, accounting for 28% of GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts.
As a result of the tsunami, the GDP contracted by about 3.6% in 2005.
===Tourism===The Maldives remained largely unknown to tourists until the early 1970s.
In just three and a half decades, the industry became the main source of income.
# A current is induced in a loop of wire when it is moved towards or away from a magnetic field, or a magnet is moved towards or away from it, the direction of current depending on that of the movement.
As he was setting up his materials, he noticed a compass needle deflected from magnetic north when the electric current from the battery he was using was switched on and off.
As a consequence, the square of the speed of light appears explicitly in some of the equations interrelating quantities in this system.
In the International System of Units (SI), the standard unit of area is the square metre (written as m2), which is the area of a square whose sides are one metre long.
A shape with an area of three square metres would have the same area as three such squares.
For a solid shape such as a sphere, cone, or cylinder, the area of its boundary surface is called the surface area.

Botswana is dominated by the Kalahari Desert, which covers up to 70% of its land surface.
===Ecology===Botswana has diverse areas of wildlife habitat.
In addition to the delta and desert areas, there are grasslands and savannas, where blue wildebeest, antelopes, and other mammals and birds are found.
Northern Botswana has one of the few remaining large populations of the endangered African wild dog.
The desertification problems predominantly stem from the severe times of drought in the country.
Surface water is scarce in Botswana and less than 5% of the agriculture in the country is sustainable by rainfall.
Since raising livestock has proven to be profitable for the people of Botswana, the land continues to be exploited.
From 1966 to 1991 the livestock population has increased from 1.7 million to 5.5 million.
Similarly, the human population has increased from 574,000 in 1971 to 1.5 million in 1995, nearly a 200% increase.
"Over 50% of all households in Botswana own cattle, which is currently the largest single source of rural income.

The majority of Christians in the country are Catholic, while the remaining comprises various other Christian denominations.
Followers of Islam make up less than 2% of the population, and this is primarily due to an influx of foreign workers into the urban centers.
The Party of Democratic Convergence (PCD) won a majority of seats in the National Assembly, with the MLSTP becoming an important and vocal minority party.
In early legislative elections in October 1994, the MLSTP won a plurality of seats in the Assembly.

The Provisional Government dissolved the parliament by force, which the social democrats considered illegal since the right to do so had been stripped from the Russians by the Power Act.
The October Revolution in Russia changed the game anew.
Suddenly, the right-wing parties in Finland started to reconsider their decision to block the transfer of highest executive power from the Russian government to Finland, as radical Communists took power in Russia.
Rather than acknowledge the authority of the "Power Law" of a few months earlier, the right-wing government declared independence on 6 December 1917.

Despite close relations with the Soviet Union, Finland remained a Western European market economy.
Financial and product market regulation was loosened.
Finland joined the European Union in 1995, and the Eurozone in 1999.
As a preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 1999; this is why the first euro coins from Finland have the year 1999 on them, instead of 2002 like some of the other countries of the Eurozone.
In 2007, in order to adopt the new common map like the rest of the Eurozone countries, Finland changed the common side of its coins.

The idea of a determinant was developed by Japanese mathematician Kowa Seki in the 17th century, followed independently by Gottfried Leibniz ten years later, for the purpose of solving systems of simultaneous linear equations using matrices.
Paolo Ruffini was the first person to develop the theory of permutation groups, and like his predecessors, also in the context of solving algebraic equations.
It is taught to students who are presumed to have no knowledge of mathematics beyond the basic principles of arithmetic.
This step leads to the conclusion that it is not the nature of the specific numbers that allows us to solve it, but that of the operations involved.
)* It allows the formulation of functional relationships.
A related class of problems is finding algebraic expressions for the roots of a polynomial in a single variable.
Sets: Rather than just considering the different types of numbers, abstract algebra deals with the more general concept of "sets": a collection of all objects (called elements) selected by property specific for the set.
All collections of the familiar types of numbers are sets.
Set theory is a branch of logic and not technically a branch of algebra.

Al-Khwārizmī accomplished most of his work in the period between 813 and 833.
After the Islamic conquest of Persia, Baghdad became the centre of scientific studies and trade, and many merchants and scientists from as far as China and India traveled to this city, as did Al-Khwārizmī.
He worked in Baghdad as a scholar at the House of Wisdom established by Caliph al-Ma’mūn, where he studied the sciences and mathematics, which included the translation of Greek and Sanskrit scientific manuscripts.
A unique Arabic copy is kept at Oxford and was translated in 1831 by F. Rosen.
A Latin translation is kept in Cambridge.
For example, "x"2 + 14 = "x" + 5 is reduced to "x"2 + 9 = "x".
The translation was most likely done in the twelfth century by Adelard of Bath, who had also translated the astronomical tables in 1126.
The original Arabic version (written c. 820) is lost, but a version by the Spanish astronomer Maslamah Ibn Ahmad al-Majriti (c. 1000) has survived in a Latin translation, presumably by Adelard of Bath (January 26, 1126).
The four surviving manuscripts of the Latin translation are kept at the Bibliothèque publique (Chartres), the Bibliothèque Mazarine (Paris), the Biblioteca Nacional (Madrid) and the Bodleian Library (Oxford).
As Paul Gallez points out, this excellent system allows the deduction of many latitudes and longitudes where the only extant document is in such a bad condition as to make it practically illegible.
Al-Khwārizmī corrected Ptolemy's gross overestimate for the length of the Mediterranean Sea from the Canary Islands to the eastern shores of the Mediterranean; Ptolemy overestimated it at 63 degrees of longitude, while al-Khwarizmi almost correctly estimated it at nearly 50 degrees of longitude.
He "also depicted the Atlantic and Indian Oceans as open bodies of water, not land-locked seas as Ptolemy had done.
Similar material is found in the works of al-Bīrūnī and Maimonides.
Other papers, such as one on the determination of the direction of Mecca, are on the spherical astronomy.

The Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut is the third oldest museum in the Middle East, exhibiting a wide range of artifacts from Lebanon and neighboring countries.
===Media===Beirut is a main center for the television, newspaper, and book publishing industries.
Temporarily the east was again dominant as the Byzantine Empire formed from the eastern half of the Roman empire.
As the naval prowess of the European powers increased, they confronted Ottoman expansion in the region when the Battle of Lepanto checked the power of the Ottoman Navy.
The Messinian salinity crisis occurred in the late Miocene (12 million years ago to 5 million years ago) when the Mediterranean dried up.
The Western Mediterranean covers an area of about 0.85 million km² (0.33 million mi²) and the Eastern Mediterranean about 1.65 million km² (0.64 million mi²).
According to a report published by "Nature" in 2009, some scientists think that the Mediterranean Sea was mostly filled during a time period of less than two years, in a major flood (the "Zanclean flood") that happened approximately 5.33 million years ago, in which water poured in from the Atlantic Ocean and through the Strait of Gibraltar, at a rate three orders of magnitude larger than the current flow of the Amazon River.
In addition, the Hellenic Arc experienced a rapid rotation phase during the Pleistocene, with a counterclockwise component in its eastern portion and a clockwise trend in the western segment.
The Alboran Sea is a transition zone between the two seas, containing a mix of Mediterranean and Atlantic species.
The Red Sea is higher than the Eastern Mediterranean, so the canal serves as a tidal strait that pours Red Sea water into the Mediterranean.
The Bitter Lakes, which are hyper-saline natural lakes that form part of the canal, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalised with that of the Red Sea, the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonise the Eastern Mediterranean.
The Red Sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the Atlantic, so the Red Sea species have advantages over Atlantic species in the salty and nutrient-poor Eastern Mediterranean.
Invasive species have become a major component of the Mediterranean ecosystem and have serious impacts on the Mediterranean ecology, endangering many local and endemic Mediterranean species.
A first look at some groups of exotic species show that more than 70% of the non-indigenous decapods and about 63% of the exotic fishes occurring in the Mediterranean are of Indo Pacific origin, introduced into the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature definition, as well as Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and Ramsar Convention terminologies, they are alien species, as they are non-native (non-indigenous) to the Mediterranean Sea, and they are outside their normal area of distribution which is the Indo-Pacific region.
In the context of CBD, "introduction" refers to the movement by human agency, indirect or direct, of an alien species outside of its natural range (past or present).
====Arrival of new tropical Atlantic species====In recent decades, the arrival of exotic species from the tropical Atlantic has become a noticeable feature.
Whether this reflects an expansion of the natural area of these species that now enter the Mediterranean through the Gibraltar strait, because of a warming trend of the water caused by global warming; or an extension of the maritime traffic; or is simply the result of a more intense scientific investigation, is still an open question.
===Pollution===Pollution in this region has been extremely high in recent years.
One of them is the Mediterranean Monk Seal which is considered to be among the world's most endangered marine mammals.
It is estimated that approximately 220,000 merchant vessels of more than 100 tonnes cross the Mediterranean Sea each year—about one third of the world's total merchant shipping.
These ships often carry hazardous cargo, which if lost would result in severe damage to the marine environment.
The Mediterranean Sea constitutes 0.7% of the global water surface and yet receives seventeen percent of global marine oil pollution.
Approximately of oil are transported annually in the Mediterranean Sea (more than 20% of the world total), with around 250-300 oil tankers crossing the Sea every day.
A major oil spill could occur at any time in any part of the Mediterranean.
In 1999, Greenpeace published a report revealing that the amount of bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean had decreased by over 80% in the previous 20 years and government scientists warn that without immediate action the stock will collapse.

It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east.
Although it does not border Zimbabwe, less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates them at their closest points.
It gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence.
The port of Walvis Bay and the offshore Penguin Islands had been annexed by the Cape Colony under the British crown by 1878 and had become an integral part of the new Union of South Africa at its creation in 1910.
Uprisings and demands by African leaders led the UN to assume direct responsibility over the territory.
Namibia obtained full independence from South Africa in 1990, with the exception of Walvis Bay and the Penguin Islands, which remained under South African control until 1994.
Before its independence in 1990, the area was known first as German South-West Africa ("Deutsch-Südwestafrika"), then as South-West Africa, reflecting the colonial occupation by the Germans and the South Africans (technically on behalf of the British crown reflecting South Africa's dominion status within the British Empire).
However, like most of Sub-Saharan Africa, Namibia was not extensively explored by Europeans until the 19th century, when traders and settlers arrived, principally from Germany and Sweden.
In the late 19th century Dorsland trekkers crossed the area on their way from the Transvaal to Angola.
===German rule===Namibia became a German colony in 1884 under Otto von Bismarck to forestall British encroachment and was known as German South-West Africa ("Deutsch-Südwestafrika").
However, the Palgrave mission by the British governor in Cape Town had determined that only the natural deep-water harbour of Walvis Bay (Walfisch in German, Walvis in Afrikaans, Whale in English) was worth occupying – and this was annexed to the Cape province of British South Africa.
The South African government also appointed the SWA administrator, who had extensive powers.
During the 1960s, when European powers granted independence to their colonies and trust territories in Africa, pressure mounted on South Africa to do so in Namibia.
In response to the 1966 ruling by the International Court of Justice, South-West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) military wing, People's Liberation Army of Namibia, a guerrilla group began their armed struggle for independence, but it was not until 1988 that South Africa agreed to end its occupation of Namibia, in accordance with a UN peace plan for the entire region.
During the South African occupation of Namibia, white commercial farmers, most of whom came as settlers from South Africa and represented 0.2% of the national population, owned 74% of the arable land.
Outside the central-southern area of Namibia (known as the "Police Zone" since the German era and which contained the main towns, industries, mines and best arable land), the country was divided into "homelands", the version of South African bantustan applied to Namibia, although only a few were actually established because indigenous Namibians often did not cooperate.
As a result, Cuba agreed to pull back its troops in southern Angola sent to support the MPLA in its war for control of Angola with UNITA.
After a new round of negotiations, a second date was set and the elections process began in earnest.
The elections were peaceful and declared free and fair.
Sam Nujoma was sworn in as the first President of Namibia watched by Nelson Mandela (who had been released from prison the previous month) and representatives from 147 countries, including 20 heads of state.
Walvis Bay was ceded to Namibia in 1994 upon the end of Apartheid in South Africa.
===After independence===Since independence Namibia has successfully completed the transition from white minority apartheid rule to parliamentary democracy.
Multiparty democracy was introduced and has been maintained, with local, regional and national elections held regularly.
Several registered political parties are active and represented in the National Assembly, although the Swapo Party has won every election since independence.
The civil war in Angola had some impact on Namibians living in the north of the country.
In 1998, Namibia Defence Force (NDF) troops were sent to the Democratic Republic of the Congo as part of a Southern African Development Community (SADC) contingent.
In August 1999, a secessionist attempt in the northeastern Zambezi Region was successfully quashed.
===Climate===Namibia extends from 17°S to 25°S: climatically the range of the sub-Tropical High Pressure Belt, arid is the overall climate description descending from the Sub-Humid (mean rain above 500 mm) through Semi-Arid between 300 and 500 mm (embracing most of the waterless Kalahari) and Arid from 150 to 300 mm (these three regions are inland from the western escarpment) to the Hyper-Arid coastal plain with less than a 100 mm mean.
Temperature maxima are limited by the overall elevation of the entire region: only in the far south, Warmbad for instance, are mid-40 °C maxima recorded.
It is situated at the southern edge of the tropics; the Tropic of Capricorn cuts the country about in half.
The winter (June – August) is generally dry, both rainy seasons occur in summer, the small rainy season between September and November, the big one between February and April.
Humidity is low, and average rainfall varies from almost zero in the coastal desert to more than 600 mm in the Caprivi Strip.
Rainfall is however highly variable, and droughts are common.
The bad rainy season with rainfall far below the annual average occurred in summer 2006/07.
Weather and climate in the coastal area are dominated by the cold, north-flowing Benguela current of the Atlantic Ocean which accounts for very low precipitation (50 mm per year or less), frequent dense fog, and overall lower temperatures than in the rest of the country.
As the area behind the coast is a desert, these winds can develop into sand storms with sand deposits in the Atlantic Ocean visible on satellite images.
"Efundja", the annual flooding of the northern parts of the country, often causes not only damage to infrastructure but loss of life.
The rains that cause these floods originate in Angola, flow into Namibia's Cuvelai basin, and fill the "Oshanas" (Oshiwambo: flood plains) there.
The worst floods occurred in March 2011 and displaced 21,000 people.
The Ministry of Environment and Tourism with the financial support from organisations such as USAID, Endangered Wildlife Trust, WWF, and Canadian Ambassador's Fund, together form a Community Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) support structure.
The main goal of this project is promote sustainable natural resource management by giving local communities rights to wildlife management and tourism.
*Judiciary: Namibia has a system of courts that interpret and apply the law in the name of the state.
While the constitution envisaged a multi-party system for Namibia's government, the SWAPO party has been dominant since independence in 1990.
With a small army and a fragile economy, the Namibian Government's principal foreign policy concern is developing strengthened ties within the Southern African region.
Namibia became the 160th member of the UN on 23 April 1990.
===Military===Namibia does not have any enemies in the region but consistently spends more as a percentage of GDP on its military than all of its neighbours, except Angola.
Military expenditure rose from 2.7% of GDP in 2000 to 3.7% in 2009, and the arrival of 12 Chengdu J-7 Airguard jets in 2006 and 2008 made Namibia for a short time one of the top arms importers in Sub-Saharan Africa.
The British formulated the plan for integrating these forces and began training the NDF, which consists of a small headquarters and five battalions.
The United Nations Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG)'s Kenyan infantry battalion remained in Namibia for three months after independence to help train the NDF and to stabilise the north.
Local authorities in Namibia can be in the form of municipalities (either Part 1 or Part 2 municipalities), town councils or villages.
The largest economic sectors are mining (10.4% of the gross domestic product in 2009), agriculture (5.0%), manufacturing (13.5%), and tourism.
According to the Namibia Labour Force Survey Report 2012, conducted by the Namibia Statistics Agency, the country's unemployment rate is 27.4%.
"Strict unemployment" (people actively seeking a full-time job) stood at 20.2% in 2000, 21.9% in 2004 and spiraled to 29.4% in 2008.
Under a broader definition (including people that have given up searching for employment) unemployment rose to 36.7% in 2004.
This estimate considers people in the informal economy as employed.
Only four African countries made the Top 20 Emerging Markets list in the March 2013 issue of Bloomberg Markets magazine, and Namibia was rated ahead of Morocco (19th), South Africa (15th) and Zambia (14th).
Worldwide, Namibia also fared better than Hungary, Brazil and Mexico.
Bloomberg Markets magazine ranked the top 20 based on more than a dozen criteria.
The data came from Bloomberg's own financial-market statistics, IMF forecasts and the World Bank.
The countries were also rated on areas of particular interest to foreign investors: the ease of doing business, the perceived level of corruption and economic freedom.
In order to attract foreign investment, the government has made improvement in reducing red tape resulted from excessive government regulations making the country one of the least bureaucratic places to do business in the region.
Namibia is also classified as an Upper Middle Income country by the World Bank, and ranks 87th out of 185 economies in terms of ease of doing business.
The cost of living in Namibia is relatively high because most of the goods including cereals need to be imported.
Business monopoly in some sectors causes higher profit bookings and further raising of prices.
Taxation in Namibia includes personal income tax, which is applicable to total taxable income of an individual and all individuals are taxed at progressive marginal rates over a series of income brackets.
The value added tax (VAT) is applicable to most of the commodities and services.
===Agriculture===About half of the population depends on agriculture (largely subsistence agriculture) for its livelihood, but Namibia must still import some of its food.
Although per capita GDP is five times the per capita GDP of Africa's poorest countries, the majority of Namibia's people live in rural areas and exist on a subsistence way of life.
Namibia has one of the highest rates of income inequality in the world, due in part to the fact that there is an urban economy and a more rural cash-less economy.
The inequality figures thus take into account people who do not actually rely on the formal economy for their survival.
Although arable land accounts for only 1% of Namibia, nearly half of the population is employed in agriculture.
The governments of Germany and Britain will finance Namibia's land reform process, as Namibia plans to start expropriating land from white farmers to resettle landless black Namibians.
An aquifer called "Ohangwena II" has been discovered, capable of supplying the 800,000 people in the North for 400 years.
Namibia is the fourth largest exporter of non-fuel minerals in Africa and the world's fourth largest producer of uranium.
There has been significant investment in uranium mining and Namibia is set to become the largest exporter of uranium by 2015.
There are offshore gas deposits in the Atlantic Ocean that are planned to be extracted in the future.
According to "The Diamond Investigation", a book about the global diamond market, from 1978, De Beers, the largest diamond company, bought most of the Namibian diamonds, and would continue to do so, because "whatever government eventually comes to power they will need this revenue to survive".
Encouraged by the rich uranium deposits the Namibian government plans to erect its first nuclear power station by 2018, also uranium enrichment is envisaged to happen locally.
===Tourism===Tourism is a major contributor (14.5%) to Namibia's GDP, creating tens of thousands of jobs (18.2% of all employment) directly or indirectly and servicing over a million tourists per annum.
Sport Hunting is also a large, and growing component of the Namibian economy, accounting for 14% of total tourism in the year 2000, or $19.6 million US dollars, with Namibia boasting numerous species sought after by international sport hunters.
In addition, extreme sports such as sandboarding, skydiving and 4x4ing have become popular, and many cities have companies that provide tours.
There is a large Chinese minority in Namibia.
===Largest cities=====Sport==The most popular sport in Namibia is association football.
Namibia were participants in the 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015 Rugby World Cups.
Cricket is also popular, with the national side having played in the 2003 Cricket World Cup.
Inline hockey was first played in 1995 and has also become more and more popular in the last years.
Namibia is the home for one of the toughest footraces in the world, the Namibian ultra marathon.
The most famous athlete from Namibia is certainly Frankie Fredericks, sprinter (100 and 200 m).
He won four Olympic silver medals (1992, 1996) and also has medals from several World Athletics Championships.
He is also known for humanitarian activities in Namibia and further.
The Swakopmund Skydiving Club in Swakopmund was founded in 1974, and operates still today from Swakopmund Airport.
==Media==Although Namibia's population is fairly small, the country has a diverse choice of media; two TV stations, 19 radio stations (without counting community stations), 5 daily newspapers, several weeklies and special publications compete for the attention of the audience.
Additionally, a mentionable amount of foreign media, especially South African, is available.
Namibia has a state-owned Press Agency, called NAMPA.
The first newspaper in Namibia was the German-language "Windhoeker Anzeiger", founded 1898.
Radio was introduced in 1969, TV in 1981.
During German rule, the newspapers mainly reflected the living reality and the view of the white German-speaking minority.
The black majority was ignored or depicted as a threat.
During South African rule, the white bias continued, with mentionable influence of the Pretoria government on the "South West African" media system.
Except for the largest newspaper, The Namibian, which is owned by a trust, the other mentioned private newspapers are part of the Democratic Media Holdings.
Other mentionable newspapers are the tabloid Informanté owned by TrustCo, the weekly Windhoek Observer, the weekly Namibia Economist, as well as the regional Namib Times.
The public broadcaster offers a TV station as well as a "National Radio" in English and nine language services in locally spoken languages.
The nine private radio stations in the country are mainly English-language channels, except for Radio Omulunga (Oshiwambo) and Kosmos 94.1 (Afrikaans).
Compared to neighbouring countries, Namibia has a large degree of media freedom.
Over the past years, the country usually ranked in the upper quarter of the Press Freedom Index of Reporters without Borders, reaching position 21 in 2010, being on par with Canada and the best-positioned African country.
The African Media Barometer shows similarly positive results.
In 2013, it was 19th.
Media and journalists in Namibia are represented by the Namibian chapter of the Media Institute of Southern Africa and the Editors' Forum of Namibia.

(City of Stockholm, 2011)==Education==Research and higher education in the sciences started in Stockholm in the 18th century, with education in medicine and various research institutions such as the Stockholm Observatory.
The Royal Institute of Technology ("Kungliga Tekniska högskolan", or "KTH") was founded in 1827 and is currently Scandinavia's largest higher education institute of technology with 13,000 students.
The Stockholm School of Economics, founded in 1909, is one of the few private institutions of higher education in Sweden.
In the fine arts, educational institutions include the Royal College of Music, which has a history going back to the conservatory founded as part of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music in 1771, the Royal University College of Fine Arts, which has a similar historical association with the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts and a foundation date of 1735, and the Swedish National Academy of Mime and Acting, which is the continuation of the school of the Royal Dramatic Theatre, once attended by Greta Garbo.
In the ensuing decades several other areas were incorporated (such as Brännkyrka Municipality in 1913, at which time it had 25,000 inhabitants, and Spånga in 1949).
It is small but well equipped, with almost 10,000 full-time military personnel.
The potato eventually formed the basis of many traditional Irish dishes after its introduction in the 16th century.
This cuisine is based on fresh vegetables, fish, oysters, mussels and other shellfish, and the wide range of hand-made cheeses that are now being produced across the country.
The most popular fish include salmon and cod.
Popular everyday beverages among the Irish include tea and coffee.
Alcoholic drinks associated with Ireland include Poitín and the world famous Guinness, which is a dry stout that originated in the brewery of Arthur Guinness at St. James's Gate in Dublin.

Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar ( ; ) and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa.
The French established trading posts along the east coast in the late 17th century.
Many European sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island, among them Robert Drury, whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century.
The Malagasy Republic was proclaimed on 14 October 1958, as an autonomous state within the French Community.
The High Constitutional Court observed in its decision that, in the absence of a language law, French still had the character of an official language.
However, there are a number of core cultural features that are common throughout the island, creating a strongly unified Malagasy cultural identity.
In addition to a common language and shared traditional religious beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors, the traditional Malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize "fihavanana" (solidarity), "vintana" (destiny), "tody" (karma), and "hasina", a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family.
The Southeast Asian cultural influence is also evident in Malagasy cuisine, in which rice is consumed at every meal, typically accompanied by one of a variety of flavorful vegetable or meat dishes.
Wood carving is a highly developed art form, with distinct regional styles evident in the decoration of balcony railings and other architectural elements.
The decorative and functional woodworking traditions of the Zafimaniry people of the central highlands was inscribed on UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008.
A small but growing number of fine art galleries in Antananarivo, and several other urban areas, offer paintings by local artists, and annual art events, such as the Hosotra open-air exhibition in the capital, contribute to the continuing development of fine arts in Madagascar.
It is traditionally practiced by men, but women have recently begun to participate.
In addition to sports, a wide variety of games are played.
Madagascar has produced a world champion in pétanque, a French game similar to lawn bowling, which is widely played in urban areas and throughout the Highlands.
Madagascar sent its first competitors to the Olympic Games in 1964 and has also competed in the African Games.
The constitution provides for an independent judicial system, made up of the High Court, the Court of Appeal, Magistrate's Courts, and traditional courts that exist predominantly in rural areas.
All but one of the Justices on the Court of Appeal are South African jurists.
There is no trial by jury; rather, judges make rulings alone or, in the case of criminal trials, with two other judges as observers.
The constitution also protects basic civil liberties, including freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press, freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of religion.
However there is a growing movement, the "People's Charter Movement", calling for the practical annexation of the country by South Africa due to the AIDS epidemic.
In May 2010 the Charter Movement delivered a petition to the South African High Commission requesting integration.
===Religion===The population of Lesotho is estimated to be around 90% Christian.
Members of other religions (Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Bahá'í, and members of traditional indigenous religions) comprise the remaining 10% of the population.
The prime minister is the head of government and proposes other ministers and secretaries of state.
Three parties now hold seats in the National Assembly — PAICV (40), MPD (30), and Cape Verdean Independent Democratic Union (UCID) (2).
On 9 November 1940 the city was awarded Poland's highest military decoration for heroism, the Virtuti Militari, during the Siege of Warsaw (1939).
After Jazdów was raided, a new similar settlement was established on the site of a small fishing village called Warszowa.
In the beginning of the 14th century it became one of the seats of the Dukes of Masovia, becoming the capital of Masovia in 1413.
===16th to 18th centuries===In 1529, Warsaw for the first time became the seat of the General Sejm, permanent from 1569.
In 1573 the city gave its name to the Warsaw Confederation, formally establishing religious freedom in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
In the following years the town expanded towards the suburbs.
Three times between 1655–1658 the city was under siege and three times it was taken and pillaged by the Swedish, Brandenburgian and Transylvanian forces.
Following the Congress of Vienna of 1815, Warsaw became the centre of the Congress Poland, a constitutional monarchy under a personal union with Imperial Russia.
The Royal University of Warsaw was established in 1816.
The Russian Empire Census of 1897 recorded 626,000 people living in Warsaw, making it the third-largest city of the Empire after St. Petersburg and Moscow.
When the fighting ended, almost all survivors were massacred, with only a few managing to escape or hide.
By July 1944, the Red Army was deep into Polish territory and pursuing the Germans toward Warsaw.
Knowing that Stalin was hostile to the idea of an independent Poland, the Polish government-in-exile in London gave orders to the underground Home Army (AK) to try to seize control of Warsaw from the Germans before the Red Army arrived.
Thus, on 1 August 1944, as the Red Army was nearing the city, the Warsaw Uprising began.
They were transported to PoW camps in Germany, while the entire civilian population was expelled.
Polish civilian deaths are estimated at between 150,000 and 200,000.
With the entry of Poland into the European Union in 2004, Warsaw is currently experiencing the largest economic boom of its history.
It is located in the heartland of the Masovian Plain, and its average elevation is above sea level.
====Flora and fauna====Greenspace covers 25% of the surface area of Warsaw, including a broad range of greenstructures, from small neighborhood parks, green spaces along streets and in courtyards, trees and avenues to large historic parks, nature conservation areas and the urban forests at the fringe of the city.
Other green spaces in the city include the Botanic Garden and the University Library garden.
They have extensive botanical collection of rare domestic and foreign plants, while a palm house in the New Orangery displays plants of subtropics from all over the world.
The Warsaw Zoo covers an area of .
There are about 5,000 animals representing nearly 500 species.
In addition to the Polish majority, there was a significant Jewish minority in Warsaw.
According to Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 638,000, Jews constituted 219,000 (around 34% percent).
Warsaw's prewar Jewish population of more than 350,000 constituted about 30 percent of the city's total population.
In 1933, out of 1,178,914 inhabitants 833,500 were of Polish mother tongue.
World War II changed the demographics of the city, and to this day there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of Warsaw's history.
Most of the modern day population growth is based on internal migration and urbanisation.
According to the 1901 census, out of 711,988 inhabitants 56.2% were Catholics, 35.7% Jews, 5% Greek orthodox Christians and 2.8% Protestants.
Eight years later, in 1909, there were 281,754 Jews (36.9%), 18,189 Protestants (2.4%) and 2,818 Mariavites (0.4%).
This led to construction of hundreds of places of religious worship in all parts of the town.
Most of them were destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.
After the war, the new communist authorities of Poland discouraged church construction and only a small part of them were rebuilt.
The city has a much improved infrastructure with new roads, flyovers, bridges, etc.
The Warsaw ring road has been planned to consist of three express roads: S2, S8 and S17.
Public transport in Warsaw includes buses, trams (streetcars), Metro, light rail Warszawska Kolej Dojazdowa line, urban railway Szybka Kolej Miejska, regional rail Koleje Mazowieckie (Mazovian Railways), and bicycle sharing systems (Veturilo and Bemowo Bike).
The first section of the Warsaw Metro was opened in 1995 initially with a total of 11 stations.
Initially, all of the trains were Russian built.
There are also five other major railway stations and a number of smaller suburban stations.
There are many sports centres in the city as well.
Most of these facilities are swimming pools and sports halls, many of them built by the municipality in the past several years.
The main indoor venue is Hala Torwar, used for all kinds of indoor sports (mainly, indoor skating rink).
It comprises much of the northern part of the Randstad, one of the larger conurbations in Europe, with a population of approximately 7 million.
This does not necessarily mean that there was already a settlement then since reclamation of land may not have been for farming—it may have been for peat, used as fuel.
Ships sailed from Amsterdam to the Baltic Sea, North America, and Africa, as well as present-day Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, and Brazil, forming the basis of a worldwide trading network.
Amsterdam's merchants had the largest share in both the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company.
In 1602, the Amsterdam office of the Dutch East India Company became the world's first stock exchange by trading in its own shares.
As of 2012, the ethnic makeup of Amsterdam was 49.5% of Dutch ancestry and 50.5% of foreign origin.
Before the Second World War, 10% of the city population was Jewish.
Catholic churches in Amsterdam have been constructed since the restoration of the episcopal hierarchy in 1853.
===Tourism===Amsterdam is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe, receiving more than 4.63 million international visitors annually, this is excluding the 16 million day trippers visiting the city every year.
The room occupation rate was 78% in 2006, up from 70% in 2005.
The outbreak of the Second World War and shifting priorities led to the current situation, where only roads A1, A2, and A4 originate from Amsterdam according to the original plan.
Schiphol is the largest airport in the Netherlands, the fourth largest in Europe, and the fourteenth largest in the world in terms of passengers.
It is located on the eastern shore of the island of Zealand, partly on the island of Amager and on a number of natural and artificial islets between the two.
Copenhagen faces the Øresund to the east, the strait of water that separates Denmark from Sweden, and which connects the North Sea with the Baltic Sea.
Dublin (, ) is the capital and largest city of Ireland.
Following the partition of Ireland in 1922, Dublin became the capital of the Irish Free State, later renamed Ireland.
This continued down to 1840 when the barony of Dublin City was separated from the barony of Dublin.
The city played no major role in the Industrial Revolution, but remained the centre of administration and a transport hub for most of the island.
Ireland had no significant sources of coal, the fuel of the time, and Dublin was not a centre of ship manufacturing, the other main driver of industrial development in Britain and Ireland.
Belfast developed faster than Dublin during this period on a mixture of international trade, factory-based linen cloth production and shipbuilding.
Dublin was European Capital of Science in 2012.
There is also a considerable number of immigrants from outside Europe, particularly from India, Pakistan, China and Nigeria.
London () is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom.

==Education==State Education in Spain is free, and compulsory from 6 to 16 years.
Other universities in Madrid, some of them private, are: Rey Juan Carlos University (public), Alfonso X University, Antonio de Nebrija University, Camilo José Cela University, Francisco de Vitoria University, European University of Madrid, Pontifical University of Salamanca–Madrid Campus, Saint Louis University Madrid Campus and San Pablo CEU University (all of them private).
In 1918, after World War I, Vienna became capital of the Republic of German-Austria, and then in 1919 of the First Republic of Austria.
Other cultural centers in Belgrade are American Corner, Austrian Cultural Forum, British Council, Chinese Confucius Institute, Canadian Cultural Center, Hellenic Foundation for Culture, Italian Istituto Italiano di Cultura, Iranian Culture Center, Azerbaijani Culture Center and Russian Center for Science and Culture.
The Museum of Aviation in Belgrade has more than 200 aircraft, of which about 50 are on display, and a few of which are the only surviving examples of their type, such as the Fiat G.50.
Belgrade also houses the Museum of African Art, founded in 1977, which has the large collection of art from West Africa.
There are also 195 primary (elementary) schools and 85 secondary schools.
The Port of Belgrade is on the Danube, and allows the city to receive goods by river.
The idea of digging or unearthing is supported by scientists who suggest that the settlement was established beyond a water-filled hole or "graba" and that the name derives from this.
According to another old legend, a city ruler was thirsty and ordered a girl named Manda to take water from Lake Manduševac (nowadays a fountain in Ban Jelačić Square), using the sentence: "Zagrabi, Mando!
A new line to Vienna using steam locomotives was opened in 1848, and a line to Pest in 1850.
Before World War I, the city had a population that was 42% ethnic German, 41% Hungarian and 15% Slovak (1910 census).
After the Communist Party seized power in Czechoslovakia in February 1948, the city became part of the Eastern Bloc.
The river passes through the city from the west to the south-east.
Budapest became a single city occupying both banks of the river Danube with its unification on 17 November 1873 of Buda and Óbuda, on the west bank, with Pest, on the east bank.
During World War II, the city again suffered significant damage, but quickly recovered in the post-war years, remaining the third largest city of the Soviet Union.
It is believed that Kiev was founded in the late 9th century (some historians have wrongly referred to as 482 AD).
Some claim to find reference to the city in Ptolemy’s work as the Metropolity (the 2nd century).
Kiev prospered during the late 19th century Industrial Revolution in the Russian Empire, when it became the third most important city of the Empire and the major centre of commerce of its southwest.
In World War II, the city again suffered significant damage, and was occupied by Nazi Germany from 19 September 1941 to 6 November 1943.
In the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine was proclaimed in the city by the Ukrainian parliament on 24 August 1991.
However, the city's unique landscape distinguishes it from the surrounding region.
Kiev is located on both sides of the Dnieper River, which flows south through the city towards the Black Sea.
In total, there are 448 bodies of open water within the boundaries of Kiev, which include Dnieper itself, its reservoirs, and several small rivers, dozens of lakes and artificially created ponds.
Snow cover usually lies from mid-November to the end of March, with the frost-free period lasting 180 days on average, but surpassing 200 days in recent years.
The historic changes in population are shown in the side table.
Ukrainians constitute the largest ethnic group in Kiev, and they account for 2,110,800 people, or 82.2% of the population.
Russians comprise 337,300 (13.1%), Jews 17,900 (0.7%), Belarusians 16,500 (0.6%), Poles 6,900 (0.3%), Armenians 4,900 (0.2%), Azerbaijanis 2,600 (0.1%), Tatars 2,500 (0.1%), Georgians 2,400 (0.1%), Moldovans 1,900 (0.1%).
At the city's southern outskirts, near the historic Pyrohiv village, there is an outdoor museum, officially called the Museum of Folk Architecture and Life of Ukraine It has an area of .
===Museums and galleries===Kiev is home to some 40 different museums.
In 2009 they recorded a total of 4.3 million visits.
The Museum of the Great Patriotic War is a memorial complex commemorating the Great Patriotic War located in the hills on the right-bank of the Dnieper River in Pechersk.
While education traditionally remains largely in the hands of the state there are several accredited private institutions in the city.
There are about 530 general secondary schools and ca.
The basin is bounded by four large mountains: Mount Aegaleo to the west, Mount Parnitha to the north, Mount Penteli to the northeast and Mount Hymettus to the east.
Mount Parnitha is the tallest of the four mountains (), and has been declared a national park.
Athens holds the World Meteorological Organization record for the highest temperature ever recorded in Europe, at , which was recorded in the Elefsina and Tatoi suburbs of Athens on 10 July 1977.
==Administration==Athens became the capital of Greece in 1834, following Nafplion, which was the provisional capital from 1829.
The region encompasses the most populated region of Greece, reaching 3,827,624 inhabitants in 2011, while it is however one of the smallest regions in the country.
Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002.
Around 89% of the population consists of ethnic Georgians, with significant populations of other ethnic groups such as Armenians, Russians, and Azeris.
At the end of the 4th century, St. Jerome, a native of Dalmatia, observed that the language spoken around Ankara was very similar to that being spoken in the northwest of the Roman world near Trier.
An estimated 200,000 people lived in Ancyra in good times during the Roman Empire, a far greater number than was to be the case from after the fall of the Roman Empire until the early 20th century.
It was thus a sizeable city by any standards and much larger than the Roman towns of Gaul or Britannia.
Three councils were held in the former capital of Galatia in Asia Minor, during the 4th century.
Baku (, ) is the capital and largest city of Azerbaijan, as well as the largest city on the Caspian Sea and of the Caucasus region.
The city's past as a Soviet industrial center has left it as one of the most polluted cities in the world.
Fifty years before the battle, Baku produced half of the world's oil supply.
It has six facilities: the main cargo terminal, the container terminal, the ferry terminal, the oil terminal, the passenger terminal and the port fleet terminal.
The port's throughput capacity reaches 15 million tons of liquid bulk and up to 10 million tons of dry cargoes.
The Heydar Aliyev International Airport is the only commercial airport serving Baku.
A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope.
Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.
It is the largest of the four giant planets in the Solar System and hence its largest planet.
Neon in the upper atmosphere only consists of 20 parts per million by mass, which is about a tenth as abundant as in the Sun.
Abundances of heavier inert gases in Jupiter's atmosphere are about two to three times that of the Sun.
Jupiter's volume is that of about 1,321 Earths, but it is only 318 times as massive.
Jupiter's radius is about 1/10 the radius of the Sun, and its mass is 0.001 times the mass of the Sun, so the density of the two bodies is similar.
So, for example, the extrasolar planet HD 209458 b has a mass of , while Kappa Andromedae b has a mass of .
Although Jupiter would need to be about 75 times as massive to fuse hydrogen and become a star, the smallest red dwarf is only about 30 percent larger in radius than Jupiter.
When it was first formed, Jupiter was much hotter and was about twice its current diameter.
In 1997, the existence of the core was suggested by gravitational measurements, indicating a mass of from 12 to 45 times the Earth's mass or roughly 4%–14% of the total mass of Jupiter.
At this depth, the temperature is above the critical temperature, which for hydrogen is only 33 K (see hydrogen).
== Atmosphere ==Jupiter has the largest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, spanning over in altitude.
As Jupiter has no surface, the base of its atmosphere is usually considered to be the point at which atmospheric pressure is equal to , or ten times surface pressure on Earth.
Mathematical models suggest that the storm is stable and may be a permanent feature of the planet.
The maximum altitude of this storm is about above the surrounding cloudtops.
In 2000, an atmospheric feature formed in the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to the Great Red Spot, but smaller.
The orbit of the material veers towards Jupiter and new material is added by additional impacts.
Because of an eccentricity of 0.048, the distance from Jupiter and the Sun varies by 75 million km between perihelion and aphelion, or the nearest and most distant points of the planet along the orbital path respectively.
The axial tilt of Jupiter is relatively small: only 3.13°.
As a result this planet does not experience significant seasonal changes, in contrast to Earth and Mars for example.
The angular diameter of Jupiter likewise varies from 50.1 to 29.8 arc seconds.
That is, for a period Jupiter seems to move backward in the night sky, performing a looping motion.
Because the orbit of Jupiter is outside the Earth's, the phase angle of Jupiter as viewed from the Earth never exceeds 11.5°.
It was recorded as fading again in 1883 and at the start of the 20th century.
By the 1670s, it was observed that when Jupiter was on the opposite side of the Sun from the Earth, these events would occur about 17 minutes later than expected.
This signal is caused by cyclotron radiation from electrons that are accelerated in Jupiter's magnetic field.
On December 19, 2000, the spacecraft captured an image of the moon Himalia, but the resolution was too low to show surface details.
Imaging of the Jovian system began September 4, 2006.
The simulated atmosphere included water, methane, ammonia and molecular hydrogen; all molecules still found in the atmosphere of Jupiter.
It is visible to the naked eye in the night sky and can occasionally be seen in the daytime when the Sun is low.
George Herbert Walker Bush (born June 12, 1924) is a retired American politician who served as the 41st President of the United States from 1989 to 1993.
Other theories involve the rare Latin term "Bosina", meaning boundary, and possible Slavic and Thracian origins.
In the Roman period, Latin-speaking settlers from the entire Roman Empire settled among the Illyrians, and Roman soldiers were encouraged to retire in the region.
The land was originally part of Illyria up until the Roman occupation.
The principalities of Serbia and Croatia split control of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 9th and 10th centuries, but by the High Middle Ages political circumstance led to the area being contested between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Byzantine Empire.
The Austro-Hungarian Empire built the three Roman Catholic churches in Sarajevo and these three churches are among only 20 Catholic churches in the state of Bosnia.
At the end of the war the establishment of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, with the constitution of 1946, officially made Bosnia and Herzegovina one of six constituent republics in the new state.
The Bosnian government did not recognize it.
The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared Herzeg-Bosnia illegal, first on 14 September 1992 and again on 20 January 1994.
The turnout in the independence referendum was 63.4 percent and 99.7 percent of voters voted for independence.
Initially, the Serb forces attacked the non-Serb civilian population in Eastern Bosnia.
2.2 million refugees were displaced by the end of the war (of all three nationalities).
The court concluded that the crimes committed during the 1992–1995 war may, according to international law, amount to crimes against humanity, but that these acts did not in themselves constitute genocide.
The Dinaric Alps generally run in an east-west direction, and get higher towards the south.
The highest point of the country is peak Maglić at 2,386 m, at the Montenegrin border.
Major mountains include Kozara, Grmeč, Vlašić, Čvrsnica, Prenj, Romanija, Jahorina, Bjelašnica and Treskavica.
Overall, close to 50% of Bosnia and Herzegovina is forested.
Most forest areas are in Central, Eastern and Western parts of Bosnia.
This farmland is a part of the Parapannonian Plain stretching into neighboring Croatia and Serbia.
It drains 76% of the country's territory into the Danube and the Black Sea.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is therefore also a member of the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR).
* The Drina flows through the eastern part of Bosnia, and for the most part it forms a natural border with Serbia.
Phytogeographically, Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to the Boreal Kingdom and is shared between the Illyrian province of the Circumboreal Region and Adriatic province of the Mediterranean Region.
The entities, based largely on the territories held by the two warring sides at the time, were formally established by the Dayton peace agreement in 1995 because of the tremendous changes in Bosnia and Herzegovina's ethnic structure.
Since 1996 the power of the entities relative to the State government has decreased significantly.
The Brčko District in the north of the country was created in 2000 out of land from both entities.
It officially belongs to both, but is governed by neither, and functions under a decentralized system of local government.
The Brčko District has been praised for maintaining a multiethnic population and a level of prosperity significantly above the national average.
The fourth level of political division in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the municipalities.
Municipalities also have their own local government, and are typically based on the most significant city or place in their territory.
As such, many municipalities have a long tradition and history with their present boundaries.
Some others, however, were only created following the recent war after traditional municipalities were split by the Inter-Entity Boundary Line.
However, the highest political authority in the country is the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the chief executive officer for the international civilian presence in the country.
Since 1995, the High Representative has been able to bypass the elected parliamentary assembly, and since 1997 has been able to remove elected officials.
The Ministry of Defense had been founded in 2004.
They are armed with a mix of American, Yugoslavian, Soviet, and European-made weaponry, vehicles, and military equipment.
Countries participating in the SAP have been offered the possibility to become, once they fulfill the necessary conditions, Member States of the EU.
On 23 April 2010, Bosnia and Herzegovina received the Membership Action Plan from NATO, which is the last step before full membership in the alliance.
Full membership is expected in 2014 or 2015, depending on the progress of reforms.
Large population migrations during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s have caused demographic shifts in the country.
According to unofficial estimates from the Bosnian State Statistics Agency cited by the US Department of State in 2008, 45 percent of the population identify religiously as Muslim, 36 percent as Serb Orthodox, 15 percent as Roman Catholic, 1 percent as Protestant, and 3 percent other (mostly atheists, Jews, and others).
The war in the 1990s caused a dramatic change in the Bosnian economy.
Figures show GDP and per capita income increased 10% from 2003 to 2004; this and Bosnia's shrinking national debt being negative trends,and high unemployment 38.7% and a large trade deficit remain cause for concern.
Annual inflation is the lowest relative to other countries in the region at 1.9% in 2004.
Real GDP growth rate was 5% for 2004 according to the Bosnian Central Bank of BiH and Statistical Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
There are many national publications, only some of which include the "Dnevni Avaz" (Daily Voice), founded in 1995, and "Jutarnje Novine" (Morning News) in circulation in Sarajevo.
The international news station Al Jazeera maintains a sister channel that caters to the Balkan region, Al Jazeera Balkans, broadcasting out of and based in Sarajevo.
Additionally, the country is the most liberated in terms of freedom of the press in the region, ranking 43rd internationally.
===Tourism===According to an estimation of the World Tourism Organization, Bosnia and Herzegovina will have the third highest tourism growth rate in the world between 1995 and 2020.
Bosnia has also become an increasingly popular skiing and Ecotourism destination.
Bosnia and Herzegovina remains one of the last undiscovered natural regions of the southern area of the Alps, with vast tracts of wild and untouched nature attracting adventurers and nature lovers.
National Geographic magazine named Bosnia and Herzegovina as the best mountain biking adventure destination for 2012.
In the 1940s the University of Sarajevo became the city's first secular higher education institute.

The complex was relocated in its entirety in 1968, on an artificial hill made from a domed structure, high above the Aswan High Dam reservoir.
Their purpose was to impress Egypt's southern neighbours, and also to reinforce the status of Egyptian religion in the region.
===Relocation===In 1959, an international donations campaign to save the monuments of Nubia began: the southernmost relics of this ancient human civilization were under threat from the rising waters of the Nile that were about to result from the construction of the Aswan High Dam.
Between 1964 and 1968, the entire site was carefully cut into large blocks (up to 30 tons, averaging 20 tons), dismantled, lifted and reassembled in a new location 65 meters higher and 200 meters back from the river, in one of the greatest challenges of archaeological engineering in history.
Some structures were even saved from under the waters of Lake Nasser.
Today, a few hundred tourists visit the temples daily.
The complex consists of two temples.
===The Great Temple===The Great Temple at Abu Simbel, which took about twenty years to build, was completed around year 24 of the reign of Ramesses the Great (which corresponds to 1265 BC).
The colossal statues were sculptured directly from the rock in which the temple was located before it was moved.
The statue to the left of the entrance was damaged in an earthquake, leaving only the lower part of the statue still intact.
The inner part of the temple has the same triangular layout that most ancient Egyptian temples follow, with rooms decreasing in size from the entrance to the sanctuary.
The temple is complex in structure and quite unusual because of its many side chambers.
In fact, according to calculations made on the basis of the heliacal rising of the star Sirius (Sothis) and inscriptions found by archaeologists, this date must have been October 22.
The plan of the Small Temple is a simplified version of that of the Great Temple.

African trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness is a parasitic disease of humans and other animals.
This begins one to three weeks after the bite.
Prevention of severe disease involves screening the population at risk with blood tests for T.b.g.
Treatment is easier when the disease is detected early and before neurological symptoms occur.
Treatment of the first stage is with the medications pentamidine or suramin.
The symptoms change over the course of the infection.
In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild and may include: fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite.
This includes enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in 20 to 30% leading to heart failure.
An enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in 10% of people.
Diagnosis of early disease is by finding the parasite in the blood using a microscope.
Chronic disease is diagnosed by finding antibodies for "T. cruzi" in the blood.
It is estimated that 7 to 8 million people, mostly in Mexico, Central America and South America have Chagas disease.
It results in about 12,500 deaths a year as of 2006.
Most people with the disease are poor and most people with the disease do not realize they are infected.
Large-scale population movements have increased the areas where cases of Chagas disease are found and these now include many European countries and the United States.
These areas have also seen an increase in the years up to 2014.
The disease was first described in 1909 by Carlos Chagas after whom it is named.

The history of Greece encompasses the history of the territory of the modern state of Greece, as well as that of the Greek people and the areas they ruled historically.
The scope of Greek habitation and rule has varied much through the ages, and, as a result, the history of Greece is similarly elastic in what it includes.
The Ottomans ruled Greece until the early 19th century.
==Modern Greek state (1821–)==In the early months of 1821, the Greeks declared their independence but did not achieve it until 1829.
On 20 October 1827, a combined British, French and Russian naval force destroyed the Ottoman and Egyptian armada.
The Russian minister of foreign affairs, Ioannis Kapodistrias, himself a Greek, returned home as President of the new Republic.
After his assassination the European powers helped turn Greece into a monarchy; the first King, Otto, came from Bavaria and the second, George I, from Denmark.
During the 19th and early 20th centuries Greece sought to enlarge its boundaries to include the ethnic Greek population of the Ottoman Empire.
The Ionian Islands were returned by Britain upon the arrival of the new King George I in 1863 and Thessaly was ceded by the Ottomans.
===World War II===Despite the country's numerically small and ill-equipped armed forces, Greece made a decisive contribution to the Allied efforts in World War II.
At the start of the war Greece sided with the Allies and refused to give in to Italian demands.
Italy invaded Greece by way of Albania on 28 October 1940, but Greek troops repelled the invaders after a bitter struggle (see Greco-Italian War).
The Greek campaign might have delayed German military plans against Soviet Union, and it is argued that had the German invasion of the Soviet Union started on 20 May 1941 instead of 22 June 1941, the Nazi assault against the Soviet Union might have succeeded.
When the Soviet Army began its drive across Romania in August 1944, the German Army in Greece began withdrawing north and northwestward from Greece to avoid being cut off in Greece.
Hence, the German occupation of Greece ended in October 1944.
The Resistance group ELAS seized control of Athens on 12 October 1944.
According to some analysts on the left, it represented the first example of a post-war West interference in the political situation of a foreign country.
The civil war consisted on one side of the armed forces of the postwar non-Marxist Greek administrations, and on the other, communist-led forces, and key members of the former resistance organization (ELAS), the leadership of which was controlled by the Communist Party of Greece (KKE).
Marxist and non-Marxist resistance groups fought each other in a fratricidal conflict to establish the leadership of the Greek resistance movement.
In the second phase (1944) the ascendant communists, in military control of most of Greece, confronted the returning Greek government in exile, which had been formed under Western Allied auspices in Cairo and originally included six KKE-affiliated ministers.
Although the involvement of KKE in the uprisings was universally known, the party remained legal until 1948, continuing to coordinate attacks from its Athens offices until proscription.
New attention was given to women's rights, and in 1952 suffrage for women was guaranteed in the Constitution, full Constitutional equality following, and Lina Tsaldari becoming the first female minister that decade.
Since the restoration of democracy, the stability and economic prosperity of Greece have grown remarkably.
Greece joined the European Union in 1981 and adopted the euro as its currency in 2001.
Vaccines that treat existing cancer are known as "therapeutic" cancer vaccines.
Some researchers believe that cancer cells routinely arise and are destroyed by the healthy immune system; and that cancer forms when the immune system fails to destroy them.
== Method ==One approach to cancer vaccination is to separate proteins from cancer cells and immunize cancer patients against those proteins, in the hope of stimulating an immune reaction that could kill the cancer cells.
Therapeutic cancer vaccines are being developed for the treatment of breast, lung, colon, skin, kidney, prostate, and other cancers.
On April 14, 2009, Dendreon Corporation announced that their Phase III clinical trial of Provenge, a cancer vaccine designed to treat prostate cancer, had demonstrated an increase in survival.
It received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for use in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer patients on April 29, 2010.
On April 8, 2008, New York-based company Antigenics announced that it had received approval for the first therapeutic cancer vaccine in Russia.
It is the first approval by a regulatory body of a cancer immunotherapy.
The approval is for a subset of kidney cancer patients who are at intermediate risk for disease recurrence.
The effective vaccine also should seek to provide longterm memory to prevent tumor recurrence.
The virus is foreign to the body, and therefore will express antigens that the immune system can recognize.
It is very hard to develop vaccines for viruses that mutate constantly such as influenza or HIV.
However, most clinical trials investigating a cancer vaccine have failed or had very modest responses by standardized oncologic assessment criteria described as the RECIST criteria.
The most suitable stage for a cancer vaccine is likely to be early disease, when the tumor volume is low, but the problem there is that clinical trials take upwards of five years and require high numbers of patients to reach measurable end points.
:2) Escape loss variants (cancer vaccines that target just one tumor antigen are likely to be less effective.
The most effective cancer vaccine is likely to raise an immune response against a broad range of tumor antigens to minimise the chance of the tumor being able to mutate and become resistant to the therapy.
):3) Prior treatments (numerous clinical trials in the past have treated patients who have received numerous cycles of chemotherapy.
:4) Some tumors progress very rapidly and/or unpredictably, and they can literally outpace the immune system.
Correlations are then made, typically showing that the patients who made the strongest immune responses were the ones who lived the longest, and this is taken as evidence that the vaccine is working.
The alternative explanation, however, is that the patients who made the best immune responses were the healthier patients with the better prognosis, and they would have survived longest in any event, even without the vaccine.
In other words, the immune responses may simply be a simple reflection of a better health status, not an indication that the vaccine had any beneficial effects.
=== Recommendations for success ===In January 2009, a review article was published in Expert Reviews in Anticancer Therapy (Vol 9, #1, pages 67–74) which highlighted past program failures and made recommendations for success as follows::1.
Target settings with a low or very low burden of disease; it is clear that vaccines will not work in patients with advanced metastatic disease.
The goal is to establish clinical benefit of the immunotherapy (i.e.,adjuvanted vaccine) over the standard of care, not over standard of care plus adjuvant.
Base development decisions on clinical data, not just immune responses.
He ascended to the throne on 23 July 1999 upon the death of his father, King Hassan II.
The total amount of matter in the universe (including baryons and dark matter), as measured from the CMB spectrum, accounts for only about 30% of the critical density.
The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.
It is under the jurisdiction of the North Gaza Governorate, in the Gaza Strip.
This core is similar in composition to the Earth, but more dense.
Saturn has a hot interior, reaching 11,700 °C at the core, and the planet radiates 2.5 times more energy into space than it receives from the Sun.
Most of this extra energy is generated by the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism of slow gravitational compression, but this alone may not be sufficient to explain Saturn's heat production.
==Atmosphere==The outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% helium by volume.
Its strength at the equator – 0.2 gauss (20 µT) – is approximately one twentieth of that of the field around Jupiter and slightly weaker than Earth's magnetic field.
Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons.
The underlying mechanism that causes this is unknown.
Its angular diameter is between 3.4 and 3.7 arcseconds, compared with 16 to 20 arcseconds for Saturn and 32 to 45 arcseconds for Jupiter.
This value indicates that it is made primarily of various ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane.
Hydrogen and helium constitute only a small part of the total, with between 0.5 and 1.5 Earth masses.
The remainder of the non-ice mass (0.5 to 3.7 Earth masses) is accounted for by rocky material.
This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water–ammonia ocean.
This value is close to the protosolar helium mass fraction of , indicating that helium has not settled in its centre as it has in the gas giants.
Methane molecules account for 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction below the methane cloud deck at the pressure level of 1.3 bar (130 kPa); this represents about 20 to 30 times the carbon abundance found in the Sun.
The heating of the stratosphere is caused by absorption of solar UV and IR radiation by methane and other hydrocarbons, which form in this part of the atmosphere as a result of methane photolysis.
The mixing ratio of carbon monoxide is similar at these altitudes.
This extended corona is a unique feature of Uranus.
The Uranian thermosphere, together with the upper part of the stratosphere, corresponds to the ionosphere of Uranus.
In comparison, the magnetic field of Earth is roughly as strong at either pole, and its "magnetic equator" is roughly parallel with its geographical equator.
Many of these particles probably derive from the hot atmospheric corona.
The ion and electron energies can be as high as 4 and 1.2 megaelectronvolts, respectively.
The cap and collar are thought to be a dense region of methane clouds located within the pressure range of 1.3 to 2 bar (see above).
During its previous northern solstice in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests that the north pole was not always so dim.
The names of these satellites are chosen from characters in the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.
==Coins==In 1965, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 fils.

This older name of the city would rarely be used from this point onward except in historical or poetic contexts.
The authority of the Byzantine emperor as the legitimate Roman emperor was challenged by the coronation of Charlemagne as "Imperator Augustus" by Pope Leo III in the year 800.
Their success came with surprising ease, but it was not until 548 that the major local tribes were subdued.
Despite continuing resistance from a few Gothic garrisons and two subsequent invasions by the Franks and Alemanni, the war for the Italian peninsula was at an end.
The strengthening of the Danube fleet caused the Kutrigur Huns to withdraw and they agreed to a treaty that allowed safe passage back across the Danube.
Meanwhile, the Germanic Lombards invaded Italy; by the end of the century only a third of Italy was in Byzantine hands.
Though Tiberius' general, Maurice, led an effective campaign on the eastern frontier, subsidies failed to restrain the Avars.
The main Sassanid force was destroyed at Nineveh in 627, and in 629 Heraclius restored the True Cross to Jerusalem in a majestic ceremony.
Leo the Wise died in 912, and hostilities soon resumed as Simeon marched to Constantinople at the head of a large army.
The Empire now faced the problem of a powerful Christian state within a few days' marching distance from Constantinople, as well as having to fight on two fronts.
In 941, they appeared on the Asian shore of the Bosphorus, but this time they were crushed, an indication of the improvements in the Byzantine military position after 907, when only diplomacy had been able to push back the invaders.
==== Apex ====By 1025, the date of Basil II's death, the Byzantine Empire stretched from Armenia in the east to Calabria in Southern Italy in the west.
Under the Macedonian emperors, the city of Constantinople flourished, becoming the largest and wealthiest city in Europe, with a population of approximately 400,000 in the 9th and 10th centuries.
In 1054, relations between the Eastern and Western traditions within the Christian Church reached a terminal crisis, known as the East–West Schism.
At the same time, the Empire was faced with new enemies.
Provinces in southern Italy faced the Normans, who arrived in Italy at the beginning of the 11th century.

The capital city of Tiwanaku dates from as early as 1500 BC when it was a small, agriculturally based village.
The community grew to urban proportions between AD 600 and AD 800, becoming an important regional power in the southern Andes.
In 1996 satellite imaging was used to map the extent of fossilized suka kollus (flooded raised fields) across the three primary valleys of Tiwanaku, arriving at population-carrying capacity estimates of anywhere between 285,000 and 1,482,000 people.
Around AD 400, Tiwanaku went from being a locally dominant force to a predatory state.
Tiwanaku expanded its reaches into the Yungas and brought its culture and way of life to many other cultures in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile.
Tiwanaku was not a violent culture in many respects.
In order to expand its reach, Tiwanaku exercised great political astuteness, creating colonies, fostering trade agreements (which made the other cultures rather dependent), and instituting state cults.
The empire continued to grow with no end in sight.
Archaeologists note a dramatic adoption of Tiwanaku ceramics into the cultures which became part of the Tiwanaku empire.
Further, this elite's control of llama herds became a powerful control mechanism as llamas were essential for carrying goods between the civic centre and the periphery.
Through this control and manipulation of surplus resources, the elite's power continued to grow until about AD 950.
At this time a dramatic shift in climate occurred, causing a significant drop in precipitation in the Titicaca Basin, believed by archaeologists to have been on the scale of a major drought.
As the rainfall decreased, many of the cities further away from Lake Titicaca began to tender less foodstuffs to the elites.
As the surplus of food decreased, and thus the amount available to underpin their power, the control of the elites began to falter.
The capital city became the last place viable for food production due to the resiliency of the raised field method of agriculture.
Between 1438 and 1527, the Inca empire, during its last great expansion, gained control over much of what is now western Bolivia.
The Incas would not maintain control of the region for long, as the rapidly expanding Inca Empire was internally weak.
Peru (; ; ), officially the Republic of Peru (, ), is a country in western South America.
It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia, in the east by Brazil, in the southeast by Bolivia, in the south by Chile, and in the west by the Pacific Ocean.
Peru is a representative democratic republic divided into 25 regions.
This mixture of cultural traditions has resulted in a wide diversity of expressions in fields such as art, cuisine, literature, and music.
Under Spanish rule, the country adopted the denomination Viceroyalty of Peru, which became Republic of Peru after independence.
As the elite vacillated between emancipation and loyalty to the Spanish Monarchy, independence was achieved only after the occupation by military campaigns of José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar.
Recently, Peru disputed its maritime limits with Chile in the Pacific Ocean.
It is also a participant in international organizations such as the Organization of American States and the United Nations.
It borders Ecuador and Colombia to the north, Brazil to the east, Bolivia to the southeast, Chile to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west.
In the mountain region, rain is frequent during summer, and temperature and humidity diminish with altitude up to the frozen peaks of the Andes.
These measures failed to achieve their objectives of income redistribution and the end of economic dependence on developed nations.
Despite these results, most reforms were not reversed until the 1990s, when the liberalizing government of Alberto Fujimori ended price controls, protectionism, restrictions on foreign direct investment, and most state ownership of companies.
Reforms have permitted sustained economic growth since 1993, except for a slump after the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
Services account for 53% of Peruvian gross domestic product, followed by manufacturing (22.3%), extractive industries (15%), and taxes (9.7%).
Recent economic growth has been fueled by macroeconomic stability, improved terms of trade, and rising investment and consumption.
Trade is expected to increase further after the implementation of a free trade agreement with the United States signed on 12 April 2006.
Spaniards and Africans arrived in large numbers under colonial rule, mixing widely with each other and with indigenous peoples.
After independence, there has been gradual immigration from England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.
Literacy was estimated at 92.9% in 2007; this rate is lower in rural areas (80.3%) than in urban areas (96.3%).
Primary and secondary education are compulsory and free in public schools.
Since its inception, the Maya script was in use up to the arrival of the Europeans, peaking during the Maya Classical Period (c. 200 to 900).
Some elements were first deciphered in the late 19th and early 20th century, mostly the parts having to do with numbers, the Maya calendar, and astronomy.
===Historical architecture===Historic architecture can be seen almost everywhere in Al Wakrah and especially in its old areas and it is captured in mosques, old homes and harbour.
It has two round towers and was used in the past as a police office.
In addition, the house of Sheikh Ghanim Bin Abdulrahman Al-Abdulghani is considered to be a significant architectural landmark on the beach.
This building consists of two floors and windows are decorated in special shapes.

It is clinically classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.
Smoking during pregnancy and after delivery is associated with a greater risk of asthma-like symptoms.
Use of antibiotics in early life has been linked to the development of asthma.
===Genetic===Family history is a risk factor for asthma, with many different genes being implicated.
--&gt; The narrowing is typically reversible with or without treatment.
In contrast to emphysema, asthma affects the bronchi, not the alveoli.
While it may occur with any weather conditions it is more common when it is dry and cold.

Results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet.
Reducing or eliminating compounds known to sensitive people from the work place may be effective.
The treatment plan should be written down and advise adjustments to treatment according to changes in symptoms.
Cigarette smoking and second-hand smoke (passive smoke) may reduce the effectiveness of medications such as corticosteroids.
Evidence is insufficient to support use in acute exacerbations.
The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air, making it easier to receive a full dose of the drug.
It involves the delivery of controlled thermal energy to the airway wall during a series of bronchoscopies.
===Alternative medicine===Many people with asthma, like those with other chronic disorders, use alternative treatments; surveys show that roughly 50% use some form of unconventional therapy.
There is little data to support the effectiveness of most of these therapies.
==Prognosis==[[File:Asthma world map - DALY - WHO2004.svg_thumb_alt=A map of the world with Europe shaded yellow, most of North and South America orange and Southern Africa a dark red_Disability-adjusted life year for asthma per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004.
The prognosis for asthma is generally good, especially for children with mild disease.
Mortality has decreased over the last few decades due to better recognition and improvement in care.
Globally it causes moderate or severe disability in 19.4 million people as of 2004 (16 million of which are in low and middle income countries).
Of asthma diagnosed during childhood, half of cases will no longer carry the diagnosis after a decade.
Early treatment with corticosteroids seems to prevent or ameliorates a decline in lung function.
==Epidemiology==As of 2011, 235–330 million people worldwide are affected by asthma, and approximately 250,000–345,000 people die per year from the disease.
It is more common in developed than developing countries.
Within developed countries it is more common in those who are economically disadvantaged while in contrast in developing countries it is more common in the affluent.
Global rates of asthma have increased significantly between the 1960s and 2008 with it being recognized as a major public health problem since the 1970s.
Rates of asthma have plateaued in the developed world since the mid-1990s with recent increases primarily in the developing world.
Asthma affects approximately 7% of the population of the United States and 5% of people in the United Kingdom.
In 1873, one of the first papers in modern medicine on the subject tried to explain the pathophysiology of the disease while one in 1872, concluded that asthma can be cured by rubbing the chest with chloroform liniment.
Bosworth theorized a connection between asthma and hay fever.
Epinephrine was first referred to in the treatment of asthma in 1905.
The effects of this catastrophe were so devastating that it took life on land 30 million years into the Mesozoic to recover.

Most of our oil and gas are obtained from Pennsylvanian sediments.
It is thought that the Earth itself coalesced from material in orbit around the Sun roughly 4500 Ma, or 4.5 billion years ago (Ga), and may have been struck by a very large (Mars-sized) planetesimal shortly after it formed, splitting off material that formed the Moon (see Giant impact hypothesis).
==Life before the Cambrian==It is not known when life originated, but carbon in 3.8 billion year old rocks from islands off western Greenland may be of organic origin.
Well-preserved bacteria older than 3.46 billion years have been found in Western Australia.
Probable fossils 100 million years older have been found in the same area.

Iraq, known in classical antiquity as Mesopotamia, was home to the oldest civilizations in the world, with a cultural history of over 10,000 years, hence its common epithet, the Cradle of Civilization.
Mesopotamia, as part of the larger Fertile Crescent, was a significant part of the Ancient Near East throughout the Bronze Age and the Iron Age.
Arabs have been the majority of Iraq's population since Sassanid times.
Iraq was ruled by the indigenous empires, Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, Assyrian and also by foreign empires: Median, Achaemenid, Seleucid, Parthian and Sassanian empires during the Iron Age and Classical Antiquity, before Iraq was conquered by the Muslim Rashidun Caliphate in the 7th century, and became a center of the Islamic Golden Age during the medieval Abbasid Caliphate.
Ottoman rule ended with World War I, and Iraq came to be administered by the British Empire as Mandatory Iraq until the establishment of the Kingdom of Iraq in 1933.
It has been identified as having "inspired some of the most important developments in human history including the invention of the wheel, the planting of the first cereal crops and the development of cursive script, Mathematics, Astronomy and Agriculture.
It is the earliest known civilization in the world, making Iraq one of the Cradles of Civilization.
Early urbanization begins with the Ubaid period, around 5300 BC.
The Sumerian historical record remains obscure until the Early Dynastic period, when a now deciphered syllabary writing system was developed, which has allowed archaeologists to read contemporary records and inscriptions.
After this it survived as a geo-political entity until the 7th century.
