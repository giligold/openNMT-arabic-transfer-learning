Estonia (; , ), officially the Republic of Estonia (, ), is a country in the Baltic region of Northern Europe.
It is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Finland, to the west by the Baltic Sea, to the south by Latvia (343 km), and to the east by Lake Peipus and Russia (338.6 km).
Across the Baltic Sea lies Sweden in the west and Finland in the north.
==History=====Prehistory===Human settlement in Estonia became possible 11,000 to 13,000 years ago, when the ice from the last glacial era melted.
According to radiocarbon dating it was settled around 11,000 years ago at the beginning of the ninth millennium BC.
Evidence has been found of hunting and fishing communities existing around 6500 BC near the town of Kunda in northern Estonia.
Bone and stone artefacts similar to those found at Kunda have been discovered elsewhere in Estonia, as well as in Latvia, northern Lithuania and in southern Finland.
This is the only word of their language recorded from antiquity.
Their sailing vessels were called pirate ships by Henry of Livonia in his Latin chronicles written at the beginning of the 13th century.
Perhaps the most famous raid by Oeselian pirates occurred in 1187, with the attack on the Swedish town of Sigtuna by Finnic raiders from Couronia and Oesel.
The former was a warship, the latter mainly a merchant ship.
The superior god of Oeselians as described by Henry of Livonia was called Tharapita.
According to the legend in the chronicle Tharapita was born on a forested mountain in Virumaa (), mainland Estonia from where he flew to Oesel, Saaremaa The name Taarapita has been interpreted as "Taara, help!
He managed to assemble an army of 6,000 Estonian men from different counties, but he was killed during the Battle of St. Matthew's Day in September 1217.
The Duchy of Estonia was created out of the northern parts of the country and was a direct dominion of the King of Denmark from 1219 until 1346, when it was sold to the Teutonic Order and became part of the Ordenstaat.
In 1343, the people of northern Estonia and Saaremaa rebelled against German rule in the St. George's Night Uprising, which was put down by 1345.
Reval (known as Tallinn since 1918) gained Lübeck Rights in 1248 and joined an alliance of trading guilds called the Hanseatic League at the end of the thirteenth century.
After the decline of the Teutonic Order following its defeat in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, and the defeat of the Livonian Order in the Battle of Swienta on 1 September 1435, the Livonian Confederation Agreement was signed on 4 December 1435.
Language, education, religion, and politics were transformed.
Church services were now conducted in the vernacular instead of in Latin, previously used.
During the Livonian War in 1561, northern Estonia submitted to Swedish control.
In 1629, mainland Estonia came entirely under Swedish rule.
This division persisted until the early twentieth century.
In 1632, a printing press and university were established in the city of Dorpat (known as Tartu since 1918).
This period is known in Estonian history as "the Good Old Swedish Time.
"The population of Estonia increased steadily until the outbreak of the plague in 1657.
During the Great Famine of 1695–97 some 70,000 people perished – almost 20% of the population.
The war devastated the population of Estonia, but it recovered quickly.
Among the leaders of the movement were Johann Voldemar Jannsen, Jakob Hurt and Carl Robert Jakobson.
In response to a period of Russification initiated by the Russian Empire in the 1890s, Estonian nationalism took on more political tones, with intellectuals first calling for greater autonomy and, later, complete independence from the Russian Empire.
===Declaration of independence===Following the Bolshevik takeover of power in Russia after the October Revolution of 1917 and German victories against the Russian army, between the Russian Red Army's retreat and the arrival of advancing German troops, the Committee of Elders of the Maapäev issued the Estonian Declaration of Independence in Pärnu on 23 February and in Tallinn on 24 February 1918.
After winning the Estonian War of Independence against both Soviet Russia and the German Freikorps and "Baltische Landeswehr" volunteers, the Tartu Peace Treaty was signed on 2 February 1920.
The Republic of Estonia was recognised (de jure) by Finland on 7 July 1920, Poland on 31 December 1920, Argentina on 12 January 1921, by the Western Allies on 26 January 1921 and by India on 22 September 1921.
Initially a parliamentary democracy, the parliament (Riigikogu) was disbanded in 1934, following political unrest caused by the global economic crisis.
===World War II===The fate of Estonia in World War II was decided by the German–Soviet Nonaggression Pact and its of August 1939.
World War II began with the invasion and subsequent partition of an important regional ally of Estonia – Poland, by a joint operation of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.
On 12 June 1940, the order for a total military blockade on Estonia was given to the Soviet Baltic Fleet.
The Red Army exited from their military bases in Estonia on 17 June.
Finally the military resistance was ended with negotiations and the Independent Signal Battalion surrendered and was disarmed.
There were two dead Estonian servicemen, Aleksei Männikus and Johannes Mandre, and several wounded on the Estonian side and about ten killed and more wounded on the Soviet side.
On 6 August 1940, Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union as the Estonian SSR.
Instead the vote to join the Soviet Union was taken by those elected in the elections held the previous month.
Repressive actions were also taken against thousands of ordinary people.
Political prisoners who could not be evacuated were executed by the NKVD.
Contemporary Russian politicians deny that the Republic of Estonia was illegally annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
They state that the Soviet troops had entered Estonia in 1940 following the agreement and with the consent of the government of the Republic of Estonia, regardless of how their actions can be interpreted today.
They maintain that the USSR was not in a state of war and was not waging any combat activities on the territory of Estonia; therefore there could be no occupation.
The Red Army retreated behind the Pärnu River – Emajõgi line on 12 July.
After the Soviets were driven out from Estonia, German troops disarmed all the partisan groups.
The Germans used Estonia's resources for their war effort; for the duration of the occupation Estonia was incorporated into the German province of Ostland.
===Soviet Estonia===The Soviet forces reconquered Estonia in the autumn of 1944 after battles in the northeast of the country on the Narva river, on the Tannenberg Line (Sinimäed), in Southeast Estonia, on the Emajõgi river, and in the West Estonian Archipelago.
In the face of the country being re-occupied by the Red Army, tens of thousands of Estonians (including a majority of the education, culture, science, political and social specialists) (estimates as many as 80,000) chose to either retreat with the Germans or flee to Finland or Sweden.
More than 10% of the entire adult Baltic population was deported or sent to Soviet labour camps.
After World War II, as part of the goal to more fully integrate Baltic countries into the Soviet Union, mass deportations were conducted in the Baltic countries and the policy of encouraging Soviet immigration to the Baltic states continued.
In addition to the human and material losses suffered due to war, thousands of civilians were killed and tens of thousands of people deported from Estonia by the Soviet authorities until Joseph Stalin's death in 1953.
Half the deported perished, and the other half were not allowed to return until the early 1960s (years after Stalin's death).
This conflict continued into the early 1950s.
Material damage caused by the world war and the following Soviet era significantly slowed Estonia's economic growth, resulting in a wide wealth gap in comparison with neighbouring Finland and Sweden.
Militarization was another aspect of the Soviet state.
Large parts of the country, especially the coastal areas, were closed to all but the Soviet military.
People not actually residing there were restricted from travelling to them without a permit.
A notable closed military installation was the city of Paldiski, which was entirely closed to all public access.
The city had a support base for the Soviet Baltic Fleet's submarines and several large military bases, including a nuclear submarine training centre complete with a full-scale model of a nuclear submarine with working nuclear reactors.
The Paldiski reactors building passed into Estonian control in 1994 after the last Russian troops left the country.
Immigration was another effect of Soviet occupation.
Hundreds of thousands of migrants were relocated to Estonia from other parts of the Soviet Union to assist industrialisation and militarisation, contributing an increase of about half a million people within 45 years.
Estonia's return to independence became possible as the Soviet Union faced internal regime challenges, loosening its hold on the outer empire.
As the 1980s progressed, a movement for Estonian autonomy started.
The 2004 enlargement of the European Union was the largest single expansion of the European Union, both in terms of territory and population, but not in terms of gross domestic product (wealth).
Estonia was among a group of ten countries admitted to the EU on 1 May 2004.
The Treaty of Accession 2003 was signed on 16 April 2003.
The Estonian political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1992 constitutional document.
===Government===The Government of Estonia () or the executive branch is formed by the Prime Minister of Estonia, nominated by the president and approved by the parliament.
The prime minister also has the right to appoint other ministers and assign them a subject to deal with.
The prime minister has the right to appoint a maximum of three such ministers, as the limit of ministers in one government is fifteen.
It is also known as the cabinet.
The government, headed by the prime minister, thus represents the political leadership of the country and makes decisions in the name of the whole executive power.
Internet voting is used in elections in Estonia.
The first internet voting took place in the 2005 local elections and the first in a parliamentary election was made available for the 2007 elections, in which 30,275 individuals voted over the internet.
Voters have a chance to invalidate their electronic vote in traditional elections, if they wish to.
===Law===According to the Constitution of Estonia () the supreme power of the state is vested in the people.
The people exercise their supreme power of the state on the elections of the Riigikogu through citizens who have the right to vote.
The supreme judicial power is vested in the Supreme Court or Riigikohus, with nineteen justices.
The president, however, does not use these rights very often, having a largely ceremonial role.
He or she is elected by Riigikogu, with two-thirds of the votes required.
As in other spheres, Estonian law-making has been successfully integrated with the Information Age.
===Foreign relations===Estonia was a member of the League of Nations from 22 September 1921, has been a member of the United Nations since 17 September 1991, and of NATO since 29 March 2004, as well as the European Union since 1 May 2004.
Estonia has also signed the Kyoto Protocol.
Indeed, Estonians consider themselves a Nordic people rather than Balts, based on their historical ties with Sweden, Denmark and particularly Finland.
In 2005, Estonia joined the European Union's Nordic Battle Group.
Whereas in 1992 Russia accounted for 92% of Estonia's international trade, today there is extensive economic interdependence between Estonia and its Nordic neighbours: three quarters of foreign investment in Estonia originates in the Nordic countries (principally Finland and Sweden), to which Estonia sends 42% of its exports (as compared to 6.5% going to Russia, 8.8% to Latvia, and 4.7% to Lithuania).
On the other hand, the Estonian political system, its flat rate of income tax, and its non-welfare-state model distinguish it from the Nordic countries and their Nordic model, and indeed from many other European countries.
===Military===The military of Estonia is based upon the Estonian Defence Forces (), which is the name of the unified armed forces of the republic with "Maavägi" (Army), "Merevägi" (Navy), "Õhuvägi" (Air Force) and a paramilitary national guard organisation "Kaitseliit" (Defence League).
The current national military service () is compulsory for men between 18 and 28, and conscripts serve eight-month to eleven-month tours of duty depending on the army branch they serve in.
In 2008, annual military spending reached 1.85% of GDP, or 5 billion kroons, and was expected to continue to increase until 2010, when a 2.0% level was anticipated.
The Estonian Defence Forces have also previously had military missions in Croatia from March until October 1995, in Lebanon from December 1996 until June 1997 and in Macedonia from May until December 2003.
Estonia participates in the Nordic Battlegroup and has announced readiness to send soldiers also to Sudan to Darfur if necessary, creating the very first African peacekeeping mission for the armed forces of Estonia.
In 2007, a military doctrine of an e-military of Estonia was officially introduced as the country was under massive cyberattacks in 2007.
The main cyber warfare facility is the Computer Emergency Response Team of Estonia (CERT), founded in 2006.
The organisation operates on security issues in local networks.
==Economy==As a member of the European Union, Estonia is considered a high-income economy by the World Bank.
The country is ranked 11th in the 2014 Index of Economic Freedom, and the 4th freest economy in Europe.
The unemployment rate is around 11.7%, which is above the EU average, while real GDP growth in 2011 was 8.0%, five times the euro-zone average.
In 2012, Estonia remained the only euro member with a budget surplus, and with a national debt of only 6%, it is one of the least indebted countries in Europe.
Trade focused on the local market and the West, particularly Germany and the United Kingdom.
Only 3% of all commerce was with the USSR.
Before the Second World War Estonia was mainly an agricultural country whose products such as butter, milk and cheese were widely known on the western European markets.
Estonia's market reforms put it among the economic leaders in the former COMECON area.
In 1994, based on the economic theories of Milton Friedman, Estonia became one of the first countries to adopt a flat tax, with a uniform rate of 26% regardless of personal income.
In January 2005, the personal income tax rate was reduced to 24%.
The income tax rate was decreased to 21% by January 2008.
In 1999, Estonia experienced its worst year economically since it regained independence in 1991, largely because of the impact of the 1998 Russian financial crisis.
Estonia joined the WTO in November 1999.
With assistance from the European Union, the World Bank and the Nordic Investment Bank, Estonia completed most of its preparations for European Union membership by the end of 2002 and now has one of the strongest economies of the new member states of the European Union.
Estonia joined the OECD in 2010.
The country has large oil shale and limestone deposits, along with forests that cover 48% of the land.
In addition to oil shale and limestone, Estonia also has large reserves of phosphorite, pitchblende, and granite that currently are not mined, or not mined extensively.
The country currently exports around 3000 tonnes per annum, representing around 2% of world production.
In recent years, public debate has discussed whether Estonia should build a nuclear power plant to secure energy production after closure of old units in the Narva Power Plants, if they are not reconstructed by the year 2016.
In 2007, the construction industry employed more than 80,000 people, around 12% of the entire country's workforce.
Another important industrial sector is the machinery and chemical industry, which is mainly located in Ida-Viru County and around Tallinn.
The oil shale based mining industry, which is also concentrated in East-Estonia, produces around 90% of the entire country's electricity.
Although the amount of pollutants emitted to the air have been falling since the 1980s, the air is still polluted with sulphur dioxide from the mining industry that the Soviet Union rapidly developed in the early 1950s.
In some areas the coastal seawater is polluted, mainly around the Sillamäe industrial complex.
Estonia is a dependent country in the terms of energy and energy production.
In recent years many local and foreign companies have been investing in renewable energy sources.
The importance of wind power has been increasing steadily in Estonia and currently the total amount of energy production from wind is nearly 60 MW while at the same time roughly 399 MW worth of projects are currently being developed and more than 2800 MW worth of projects are being proposed in the Lake Peipus area and the coastal areas of Hiiumaa.
Currently, there are plans to renovate some older units of the Narva Power Plants, establish new power stations, and provide higher efficiency in oil shale based energy production.
Estonia liberalised 35% of its electricity market in April 2010.
The electricity market as whole will be liberalised by 2013.
Estonia has a strong information technology sector, partly owing to the Tiigrihüpe project undertaken in mid-1990s, and has been mentioned as the most "wired" and advanced country in Europe in the terms of e-Government of Estonia.
Skype was written by Estonia-based developers Ahti Heinla, Priit Kasesalu, and Jaan Tallinn, who had also originally developed Kazaa.
===Trade===Estonia has had a market economy since the end of the 1990s and one of the highest per capita income levels in Eastern Europe.
The current government has pursued tight fiscal policies, resulting in balanced budgets and low public debt.
The oldest university is the University of Tartu, established by the Swedish king Gustav II Adolf in 1632.
In 1919, university courses were first taught in the Estonian language.
Today's education in Estonia is divided into general, vocational, and hobby.
The education system is based on four levels: pre-school, basic, secondary, and higher education.
A wide network of schools and supporting educational institutions have been established.
The Estonian education system consists of state, municipal, public, and private institutions.
There are currently 589 schools in Estonia.
===Sports===Sport plays an important role in Estonian culture.
After declaring independence from Russia in 1918, Estonia first competed as a nation at the 1920 Summer Olympics, although the National Olympic Committee was established in 1923.
Estonian athletes took part of the Olympic Games until the country was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
After regaining independence in 1991, Estonia has participated in all Olympics.

On 12 February 2009, Iraq officially became the 186th State Party to the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Under the provisions of this treaty, Iraq is considered a party with declared stockpiles of chemical weapons.
Because of their late accession, Iraq is the only State Party exempt from the existing timeline for destruction of their chemical weapons.
Specific criteria is in development to address the unique nature of Iraqi accession.
A conflict occurred in December 2009, when Iraq accused Iran of seizing an oil well on the border.
Relationships with Turkey are tense, largely because of the Kurdistan Regional Government, as clashes between Turkey and the PKK continue.

Furthermore, Kurdish is now an official language of Iraq alongside Arabic according to Article 4 of the constitution.
LGBT rights in Iraq remain limited.
Targeting people because of their gender identity or sexual orientation is not uncommon and is usually carried out in the name of family honor.

Around 20,000 Marsh Arabs live in southern Iraq.
Iraq also has a community of 2,500 Chechens.
In southern Iraq there is a community of Iraqis of African descent, a legacy of the slavery practiced in the Islamic Caliphate beginning before the Zanj Rebellion of the 9th century, and Basra's role as a key port.
Prior to the invasion in 2003, Arabic was the sole official language.

In these cities are found fragments of several great buildings which seem to have been palace-temples.
They were constructed chiefly of sun-dried bricks, and all that remains of them is the lower part of the walls, decorated with sculpture and paintings, portions of the pavements, a few indications of the elevation, and some interesting works connected with the drainage.
Nonetheless, foreign "mujahideen" volunteers came from 43 countries, and the total number that participated in the Afghan movement between 1982 and 1992 is reported to have been 35,000.
One of these was the organization that would eventually be called al-Qaeda, formed by bin Laden with an initial meeting held on August 11, 1988.
In 1991, Ali Mohammed is said to have helped orchestrate bin Laden's relocation to Sudan.
In June 1995, an even more ill-fated attempt to assassinate Egyptian president Mubarak led to the expulsion of EIJ, and in May 1996, of bin Laden, by the Sudanese government.
The bombings were an attempt to eliminate American soldiers on their way to Somalia to take part in the international famine relief effort, Operation Restore Hope.

From 1912 to 1927, the territory of Libya was known as Italian North Africa.
From 1927 to 1934, the territory was split into two colonies, Italian Cyrenaica and Italian Tripolitania, run by Italian governors.
Some 150,000 Italians settled in Libya, constituting roughly 20% of the total population.
In 1934, Italy adopted the name "Libya" (used by the Ancient Greeks for all of North Africa, except Egypt) as the official name of the colony (made up of the three provinces of Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan).
In 1944, Idris returned from exile in Cairo but declined to resume permanent residence in Cyrenaica until the removal of some aspects of foreign control in 1947.
Under the terms of the 1947 peace treaty with the Allies, Italy relinquished all claims to Libya.
===Independence, Kingdom of Libya and Libya under Gaddafi===On 24 December 1951, Libya declared its independence as the United Kingdom of Libya, a constitutional and hereditary monarchy under King Idris, Libya's only monarch.
Gaddafi was referred to as the "Brother Leader and Guide of the Revolution" in government statements and the official Libyan press.
In February 1977, Libya started delivering military supplies to Goukouni Oueddei and the People's Armed Forces in Chad.
Hundreds of Libyans lost their lives in the war against Tanzania, when Gaddafi tried to save his friend Idi Amin.
From 1977 onward, per capita income in the country rose to more than US $11,000, the fifth-highest in Africa, while the Human Development Index became the highest in Africa and greater than that of Saudi Arabia.
The Great Manmade River was also built to allow free access to fresh water across large parts of the country.
In addition, financial support was provided for university scholarships and employment programs.
Libya was finally put under United Nations sanctions after the bombing of a commercial flight killed hundreds of travellers.
On 7 July 2012, Libyans had voted in their first parliamentary elections since the end of the former regime.
It is currently being re-established by the Libyan government, as Libya's previous national army was defeated in the Libyan Civil War and disbanded.
As of November 2012, it was deemed to be still in the embryonic stage of development.
The government was also friendly towards Western countries such as the United Kingdom, United States, France, Italy, Greece, and established full diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1955.
The Kingdom was noted for its close association with the West, while it steered a conservative course at home.
After the 1969 coup, Muammar Gaddafi closed American and British bases and partly nationalized foreign oil and commercial interests in Libya.
Relations with the West were strained by a series of incidents for most of Gaddafi's rule, including the killing of London policewoman Yvonne Fletcher, the bombing of a West Berlin nightclub frequented by U.S. servicemen, and the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which led to UN sanctions in the 1990s, though by the late 2000s, the United States and other Western powers had normalised relations with Libya.
Gaddafi's decision to abandon the pursuit of weapons of mass destruction after the Iraq War saw Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein overthrown and put on trial led to Libya being hailed as a success for Western soft power initiatives in the War on Terror.
In October 2010, Gaddafi apologized to African leaders on behalf of Arab nations for their involvement in the African slave trade.
A large number of Libyan television stations are devoted to political review, Islamic topics and cultural phenomena.
A number of TV stations air various styles of traditional Libyan music.
Tuareg music and dance are popular in Ghadames and the south.
A 1996 analysis by the Committee to Protect Journalists found Libya’s media was the most tightly controlled in the Arab world during the country's dictatorship.
However as of 2012 hundreds of TV stations have begun to air due to the collapse of censorship from the old regime and the initiation of "free media".
Common Libyan foods include several variations of red (tomato) sauce based pasta dishes (similar to the Italian Sugo all'arrabbiata dish); rice, usually served with lamb or chicken (typically stewed, fried, grilled, or boiled in-sauce); and couscous, which is steam cooked whilst held over boiling red (tomato) sauce and meat (sometimes also containing courgettes/zucchini and chickpeas), which is typically served along with cucumber slices, lettuce and olives.
Kepler was the first to devise a system that described correctly the details of the motion of the planets with the Sun at the center.
Newton also developed the reflecting telescope.
The distance to a star was first announced in 1838 when the parallax of 61 Cygni was measured by Friedrich Bessel.
Although some radio waves are produced by astronomical objects in the form of thermal emission, most of the radio emission that is observed from Earth is the result of synchrotron radiation, which is produced when electrons orbit magnetic fields.
===Optical astronomy===Historically, optical astronomy, also called visible light astronomy, is the oldest form of astronomy.
In the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment.
The Maunder minimum, for example, is believed to have caused the Little Ice Age phenomenon during the Middle Ages.
The Solar System is subdivided into the inner planets, the asteroid belt, and the outer planets.
The inner terrestrial planets consist of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, and finally the Oort Cloud, which may extend as far as a light-year.
It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction.
As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view.
Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the big bang, wherein our universe began at a single point in time, and thereafter expanded over the course of 13.8 billion years to its present condition.
The concept of the big bang can be traced back to the discovery of the microwave background radiation in 1965.
In the course of this expansion, the universe underwent several evolutionary stages.
In the very early moments, it is theorized that the universe experienced a very rapid cosmic inflation, which homogenized the starting conditions.
(See also nucleocosmochronology.
Fundamental to the structure of the universe is the existence of dark matter and dark energy.
These are now thought to be its dominant components, forming 96% of the mass of the universe.
For this reason, much effort is expended in trying to understand the physics of these components.
In academia, he is known for his analysis of international relations and the introduction of Islam to the study of international conflict and of civilization.
A few months later, at the age of 75, Nizar Qabbani died in London on 30 April 1998 of a heart attack.
The Moon is the second densest satellite in the Solar System after Io.
However, the inner core of the Moon is small, with a radius of about or less, around 20% of the radius of the Moon.
The lunar far side is on average about higher than the near side.
Maria are found almost exclusively on the near side of the Moon, covering 31% of the surface on the near side, compared with a few scattered patches on the far side covering only 2%.
In 2008, an analysis of volcanic lava beads, brought back to Earth aboard Apollo 15, showed small amounts of water to exist in the interior of the beads.
However, because Earth is moving in its orbit around the Sun at the same time, it takes slightly longer for the Moon to show the same phase to Earth, which is about 29.5 days (its synodic period).
It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, though Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto, at 1/9 Pluto's mass.
Despite this, it is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun.
The Moon does appear larger when close to the horizon, but this is a purely psychological effect, known as the Moon illusion, first described in the 7th century BC.
This means the Moon can go overhead at latitudes up to 28° from the equator, instead of only 18°.
Because Earth spins about 27 times faster than the Moon moves around it, the bulges are dragged along with Earth's surface faster than the Moon moves, rotating around Earth once a day as it spins on its axis.
The ocean tides are magnified by other effects: frictional coupling of water to Earth's rotation through the ocean floors, the inertia of water's movement, ocean basins that get shallower near land, and oscillations between different ocean basins.
In turn, angular momentum is added to the Moon's orbit, accelerating it, which lifts the Moon into a higher orbit with a longer period.
As a result, the distance between Earth and Moon is increasing, and Earth's spin slowing down.
Libration also changes the angle from which the Moon is seen, allowing about 59% of its surface to be seen from Earth (but only half at any instant).
The subsequent landing of the first humans on the Moon in 1969 is seen by many as the culmination of the Space Race.
Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the Moon as the commander of the American mission Apollo 11 by first setting foot on the Moon at 02:56 UTC on 21 July 1969.
The city is at an altitude of .
When not dressed in western clothing such as jeans and T-shirts, men typically wear the "macawiis", which is a sarong-like garment worn around the waist.
In March 2008, the first Catholic Church in Doha, Our Lady of the Rosary, was opened.
Referendums were held on all four of the islands.
At this time, the population of Mayotte voted against independence from France in two referenda.
The first, held in December 1974, won 63.8% support for maintaining ties with France, while the second, held in February 1976, confirmed that vote with an overwhelming 99.4%.
A few days later, Bob Denard was evacuated to South Africa by French paratroopers.
He led the country from 1996, during a time of labor crises, government suppression, and secessionist conflicts, until his death November 1998.
Azali stepped down in 2002 to run in the democratic election of the President of the Comoros, which he won.
Under ongoing international pressure, as a military ruler who had originally come to power by force, and was not always democratic while in office, Azali led the Comoros through constitutional changes that enabled new elections.
A "Loi des compétences" law was passed in early 2005 that defines the responsibilities of each governmental body, and is in the process of implementation.
Some rebels were killed and injured, but there are no official figures.
The presidency of the Union rotates between the islands.
The judiciary is independent of the legislative and the executive.
The Supreme Court acts as a Constitutional Council in resolving constitutional questions and supervising presidential elections.
As High Court of Justice, the Supreme Court also arbitrates in cases where the government is accused of malpractice.
More recently, the Assembly has maintained this item on its agenda but deferred it from year to year without taking action.
Comoros is a member of the African Union, the Arab League, the European Development Fund, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Indian Ocean Commission and the African Development Bank.
On 10 April 2008, Comoros became the 179th nation to accept the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the leading sector of the economy, and 38.4% of the working population is employed in the primary sector.
High population densities, as much as 1000 per square kilometer in the densest agricultural zones, for what is still a mostly rural, agricultural economy may lead to an environmental crisis in the near future, especially considering the high rate of population growth.
The low educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance.
Agriculture contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports.
The government is struggling to upgrade education and technical training, to privatize commercial and industrial enterprises, to improve health services, to diversify exports, to promote tourism, and to reduce the high population growth rate.
In 2001, 34% of the population was considered urban, but that is expected to grow, since rural population growth is negative, while overall population growth is still relatively high.
For example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU farther out from the Sun than Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter, and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus.
==Formation and evolution==The Solar System formed 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud.
Within 50 million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the centre of the protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion.
The first, the zodiacal dust cloud, lies in the inner Solar System and causes the zodiacal light.
==Galactic context==The Solar System is located in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with a diameter of about 100,000 light-years containing about 200 billion stars.
The stars next closest to the Sun are the red dwarfs Barnard's Star (at 5.9 light years), Wolf 359 (7.8 light years), and Lalande 21185 (8.3 light years).
== History of religious texts ==The oldest known religious texts are the Pyramid Texts of Ancient Egypt that date to 2400-2300 BCE.
London: SOAS.
Ordinance 83.127, enacted 5 June 1983, started the process of nationalization of all land not clearly the property of a documented owner, thus abolishing the traditional system of land tenure.
Potential nationalization was based on the concept of "dead land", i.e., property which has not been developed or on which obvious development cannot be seen.
A practical effect was government seizure of traditional communal grazing lands.
Political parties, illegal during the military period, were legalized again in 1991.
By April 1992, as civilian rule returned, 16 major political parties had been recognized; 12 major political parties were active in 2004.
President Taya won elections in 1992 and 1997.
Most opposition parties boycotted the first legislative election in 1992.
For nearly a decade the parliament was dominated by the PRDS.
The opposition participated in municipal elections in January–February 1994, and in subsequent Senate elections – most recently in April 2004 – and gained representation at the local level, as well as three seats in the Senate.
This period was marked by extensive ethnic violence and human rights abuses.
The slaves were mostly black.
The rioting, added to already existing tensions, led to a campaign within the country of terror against black Mauritanians, who are often seen as 'Senegalese' by Beidanes, regardless of their nationality.
The war culminated in an international airlift agreed to by Senegal and Mauritania under international pressure to prevent further violence.
The Mauritanian Government expelled tens of thousands of black Mauritanians.
Most of these so-called 'Senegalese' had no ties to Senegal, and many still reside in refugee camps in Mali and Senegal.
The exact number of expulsions is not known but the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that, as of June 1991, 52,995 Mauritanian refugees were living in Senegal and at least 13,000 in Mali.
From November 1990 to February 1991, between 500 and 600 Fula and Soninke political prisoners were executed or tortured to death by Mauritanian government forces.
The government initiated a military investigation but never released the results.
In order to guarantee immunity for those responsible and to block any attempts at accountability for past abuses, the Parliament declared an amnesty in June 1993 covering all crimes committed by the armed forces, security forces as well as civilians, between April 1989 and April 1992.
The government offered compensation to families of victims, which a few accepted in lieu of settlement.
During the mid-to late 1990s, Mauritania shifted its foreign policy to one of increased co-operation with the US and Europe.
It was rewarded with diplomatic normalization and aid projects.
On 28 October 1999, Mauritania joined Egypt, Palestine, and Jordan as the only members of the Arab League to officially recognize Israel.
Ould Taya also started co-operating with the United States in anti-terrorism activities, a policy which was criticized by some human rights organizations.
(See also Foreign relations of Mauritania.
Parliamentary and municipal elections in Mauritania took place on 19 November and 3 December 2006.
===2007 presidential election===Mauritania's first fully democratic presidential election took place on 11 March 2007.
The election effected the final transfer from military to civilian rule following the military coup in 2005.
This was the first time since Mauritania gained independence in 1960 that it elected a president in a multi-candidate election.
The army surrounded key government facilities, including the state television building, after the president fired senior officers, one of them the head of the presidential guards.
He had recently been fired.
It found few supporters (among them Morocco, Libya and Iran), while Algeria, the United States, France and other European countries criticized the coup, and continued to refer to Abdallahi as the legitimate president of Mauritania.
The new government broke off relations with Israel.
During the spring of 2009, the junta negotiated an understanding with some opposition figures and international parties.
Abdallahi's resignation allowed the election of Abdel Aziz as civilian president, on 18 July, by a 52% majority.
In February 2011, the waves of the Arab Spring spread to Mauritania, where hundreds of people took to the streets of the capital.
Following the 2008 coup, the military government of Mauritania faced severe international sanctions and internal unrest.
These ethnic groups have been seen to contest the political, economic, and social dominance of Moors.
Armed groups such as the now-exiled FLAM have carried out low-level rebellions in the southern part of Mauritania because of these continuing discriminatory practices.
Though slavery was abolished in 1981, it was not illegal to own slaves until 2007.
In 2012, it was estimated that 10% to 20% of the population of Mauritania (between 340,000 and 680,000 people) live in slavery.

The names of at least six daughters are known, and while they played significant roles behind the scenes during his lifetime, no documents have survived that definitively provide the number or names of daughters born to the consorts of Genghis Khan.
As early as the 10th century, the identity and exact corpus of works of Jābir was in dispute in Islamic circles.
This work enjoyed a great reputation during the Middle Ages.
Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem, "Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer.
Nearly half of his surviving works are on mathematics, 23 of them are on astronomy, and 14 of them are on optics, with a few on other subjects.
In the first years of World War II, the British authorities asked Haganah for cooperation again, due to the fear of an Axis breakthrough in North Africa.
The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the Neutrality Act in August of the same year.
In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the Rome–Berlin Axis.
A month later, Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, which Italy would join in the following year.
The Nationalists won the civil war in April 1939; Franco, now dictator, bargained with both sides during the Second World War, but never concluded any major agreements.
On 23 August Hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 August, but upon hearing that Britain had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with Poland and that Italy would maintain neutrality, he decided to delay it.
Austria is one of the richest countries in the world, with a nominal per capita GDP of $52,216 (2014 est.).
The country has developed a high standard of living and in 2011 was ranked 19th in the world for its Human Development Index.
Austria has been a member of the United Nations since 1955, joined the European Union in 1995, and is a founder of the OECD.
Austria was a prefecture of Bavaria created in 976.
The word "Austria" is a Latinisation of the German name and was first recorded in the 12th century.
At the time, the Danube basin of Austria (Upper and Lower Austria) was the easternmost extent of Bavaria, and in fact of all the Germans, as at the time the territory of the former East Germany was populated by Slavic Sorbs and Polabians.
The Celtic name was eventually Latinised to "Noricum" after the Romans conquered the area that encloses most of modern day Austria, in around 15 BC.
In 1156 the Privilegium Minus elevated Austria to the status of a duchy.
In 1192, the Babenbergs also acquired the Duchy of Styria.
His reign came to an end with his defeat at Dürnkrut at the hands of Rudolph I of Germany in 1278.
Thereafter, until World War I, Austria's history was largely that of its ruling dynasty, the Habsburgs.
Although Albert himself only reigned for a year, henceforth every emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was a Habsburg, with only one exception.
Ottoman expansion into Hungary led to frequent conflicts between the two empires, particularly evident in the so-called Long War of 1593 to 1606.
With the rise of Prussia the Austrian–Prussian dualism began in Germany.
Austria participated, together with Prussia and Russia, in the first and the third of the three Partitions of Poland (in 1772 and 1795).
Two years earlier, in 1804, the Empire of Austria was founded.
In 1814 Austria was part of the Allied forces that invaded France and brought to an end the Napoleonic Wars.
It emerged from the Congress of Vienna in 1815 as one of the continent's four dominant powers and a recognised great power.
The same year, the German Confederation () was founded under the presidency of Austria.
Because of unsolved social, political and national conflicts the German lands were shaken by the 1848 revolution aiming to create a unified Germany.
A unified Germany would have been possible either as a Greater Germany, or a Greater Austria or just the German Confederation without Austria at all.
As Austria was not willing to relinquish its German-speaking territories to what would become the German Empire of 1848, the crown of the newly formed empire was offered to the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm IV.
In 1864, Austria and Prussia fought together against Denmark and secured the independence from Denmark of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein.
But as they could not agree on how the two duchies should be administered, they fought the Austro-Prussian War in 1866.
Defeated by Prussia in the Battle of Königgrätz, Austria had to leave the German Confederation and subsequently no longer took part in German politics.
As a result, ruling Austria–Hungary became increasingly difficult in an age of emerging nationalist movements, requiring considerable reliance on an expanded secret police.
Yet the government of Austria tried its best to be accommodating in some respects: The "Reichsgesetzblatt", publishing the laws and ordinances of Cisleithania, was issued in eight languages; and all national groups were entitled to schools in their own language and to the use of their mother tongue at state offices, for example.
Over one million Austro-Hungarian soldiers died in World War I.
This new government was invited by the Emperor to take part in the decision on the planned armistice with Italy, but refrained from this business.
This left the responsibility for the end of the war, on 3 November 1918, solely to the Emperor and his government.
On 11 November the emperor, advised by ministers of the old and the new government, declared he would not take part in state business any more; on 12 November German Austria, by law, declared itself to be a democratic republic and part of the new German republic.
The Treaty of Saint-Germain of 1919 (for Hungary the Treaty of Trianon of 1920) confirmed and consolidated the new order of Central Europe which to a great extent had been established in November 1918, creating new states and altering others.
These included the provinces of South Tyrol (which became part of Italy) and German Bohemia (Czechoslovakia).
The status of South Tyrol was a lingering problem between Austria and Italy until it was officially settled by the 1980s with a great degree of autonomy being granted to it by the Italian national government.
Between 1918 and 1919 Austria was known as the State of German Austria ().
Not only did the Entente powers forbid German Austria to unite with Germany, they also rejected the name German Austria in the peace treaty to be signed; it was therefore changed to Republic of Austria in late 1919.
The border between Austria and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia) was settled with the Carinthian Plebiscite in October 1920 and allocated the major part of the territory of the former Austro-Hungarian Crownland of Carinthia to Austria.
This set the border on the Karawanken mountain range, with many Slovenes remaining in Austria.
In autumn 1922 Austria was granted an international loan supervised by the League of Nations.
The purpose of the loan was to avert bankruptcy, stabilise the currency and improve Austria's general economic condition.
The loan meant that Austria passed from an independent state to the control exercised by the League of Nations.
Later it was called the Alpine dollar due to its stability.
From 1925 to 1929 the economy enjoyed a short high before nearly crashing after Black Friday.
On 1 May 1934, the Austrofascists imposed a new constitution ("Maiverfassung") which cemented Dollfuss's power but on 25 July he was assassinated in a Nazi coup attempt.
His successor Kurt Schuschnigg struggled to keep Austria independent as "the better German state", but on 12 March 1938, Austrian Nazis took over government, while German troops occupied the country.
On 13 March 1938, the "Anschluss" of Austria was officially declared.
Parliamentary elections were held in Germany (including recently annexed Austria) on 10 April 1938.
Turnout in the election was officially 99.5% with 98.9% voting "yes".
In the case of Austria, Hitler's native soil, 99.71% of an electorate of 4,484,475 officially went to the ballots, with a positive tally of 99.73%.
Vienna fell on 13 April 1945, during the Soviet Vienna Offensive just before the total collapse of the Third Reich.
However it never materialized because of the rapid collapse of the Reich.
Karl Renner and Adolf Schärf (Socialist Party of Austria Democrats and Revolutionary Socialists), Leopold Kunschak (Austria's People's Party Christian Social People's Party) and Johann Koplenig (Communist Party of Austria) declared Austria's secession from the Third Reich by the Declaration of Independence on 27 April 1945 and set up a provisional government in Vienna under state Chancellor Renner the same day, with the approval of the victorious Red Army and backed by Joseph Stalin.
(The date is officially named the birthday of the second republic.
) At the end of April, most of Western and Southern Austria was still under Nazi rule.
On 1 May 1945, the federal constitution of 1929, which had been terminated by dictator Dollfuss on 1 May 1934, was declared valid again.
Thousands of Austrians had taken part in serious Nazi crimes (hundreds of thousands died in Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp alone), a fact officially recognised by Chancellor Franz Vranitzky in 1992.
As forecast in the Moscow Declaration in 1943, there was a subtle difference in the treatment of Austria by the Allies.
The Austrian government, consisting of Social Democrats, Conservatives and Communists (until 1947), and residing in Vienna, which was surrounded by the Soviet zone, was recognised by the Western Allies in October 1945 after some doubts that Renner could be Stalin's puppet.
Austria, in general, was treated as though it had been originally invaded by Germany and liberated by the Allies.
On 15 May 1955, after talks which lasted for years and were influenced by the Cold War, Austria regained full independence by concluding the Austrian State Treaty with the Four Occupying Powers.
On 26 October 1955, after all occupation troops had left, Austria declared its "permanent neutrality" by an act of parliament.
During all other legislative periods, either a grand coalition of Conservatives and Social Democrats or a "small coalition" (one of these two and a smaller party) ruled the country.
Following a referendum in 1994, at which consent reached a majority of two-thirds, the country became a member of the European Union on 1 January 1995.
The major parties SPÖ and ÖVP have contrary opinions about the future status of Austria's military non-alignment: While the SPÖ in public supports a neutral role, the ÖVP argues for stronger integration into the EU's security policy; even a future NATO membership is not ruled out by some ÖVP politicians.
==Governance==The Parliament of Austria is located in Vienna, the country's largest city and capital.
Austria became a federal, parliamentary, democratic republic through the Federal Constitution of 1920.
The political system of the Second Republic with its nine states is based on the constitution of 1920 and 1929, which was reenacted on 1 May 1945.
The chairman of the Federal Government is the Federal Chancellor, who is appointed by the president.
Voting for the federal president and for the Parliament used to be compulsory in Austria, but this was abolished in steps from 1982 to 2004.
The composition of the Nationalrat (183 seats) is determined every five years (or whenever the Nationalrat has been dissolved by the federal president on a motion by the federal chancellor, or by Nationalrat itself) by a general election in which every citizen over 16 years (since 2007) has voting rights.
While there is a general threshold of 4% for all parties at federal elections (Nationalratswahlen), there remains the possibility to gain a direct seat, or , in one of the 43 regional election districts.
The Nationalrat is the dominant chamber in the formation of legislation in Austria.
However, the upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat, has a limited right of veto (the Nationalrat can—in almost all cases—ultimately pass the respective bill by voting a second time.
Since 1995, the European Court of Justice may overrule Austrian decisions in all matters defined in laws of the European Union.
Austria also implements the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, since the European Convention on Human Rights is part of the Austrian constitution.
Political realities prohibited any of the two major parties from forming a coalition with smaller parties.
This coalition broke up in June 2008.
Elections in September 2008 further weakened both major parties (Social Democrats and People's Party) but together they still held 70% of the votes, with the Social Democrats holding slightly more than the other party.
On 26 October 1955, the Federal Assembly passed a constitutional article in which "Austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality".
The second section of this law stated that "in all future times Austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory".
Since then, Austria has shaped its foreign policy on the basis of neutrality, but rather different from the neutrality of Switzerland.
Austria began to reassess its definition of neutrality following the fall of the Soviet Union, granting overflight rights for the UN-sanctioned action against Iraq in 1991, and, since 1995, it has developed participation in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).
Also in 1995, it joined NATO's Partnership for Peace and subsequently participated in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia.
Meanwhile, the only part of the Constitutional Law on Neutrality of 1955 still fully valid is not to allow foreign military bases in Austria.
Austria attaches great importance to participation in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and other international economic organisations, and it has played an active role in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
In recent years, it has been discussed whether today it is appropriate for a small country to maintain ten parliaments.
==Economy==Austria is the 12th richest country in the world in terms of GDP (Gross domestic product) per capita, has a well-developed social market economy, and a high standard of living.
Until the 1980s, many of Austria's largest industry firms were nationalised; in recent years, however, privatisation has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies.
Labour movements are particularly strong in Austria and have large influence on labour politics.
Next to a highly developed industry, international tourism is the most important part of the national economy.
Germany has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the German economy.
Since Austria became a member state of the European Union, it has gained closer ties to other EU economies, reducing its economic dependence on Germany.
Since the fall of communism, Austrian companies have been quite active players and consolidators in Eastern Europe.
Between 1995 and 2010, 4,868 mergers and acquisitions with a total known value of 163 bil.
EUR in 2005.
Tourism accounts for almost 9% of the Austrian gross domestic product.
In international tourist arrivals, Austria ranked 12th with 20.8 million tourists.
===Energy===In 1972, the country began construction of a nuclear-powered electricity-generation station at Zwentendorf on the River Danube, following a unanimous vote in parliament.
However, in 1978, a referendum voted approximately 50.5% against nuclear power, 49.5% for, and parliament subsequently unanimously passed a law forbidding the use of nuclear power to generate electricity.
Austria currently produces more than half of its electricity by hydropower.
Together with other renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and biomass powerplants, the electricity supply from renewable energy amounts to 62.89% of total use in Austria, with the rest being produced by gas and oil power plants.
It is known for its cultural offerings and high standard of living.
Vienna is by far the country's largest city.
All other cities have fewer than 100,000 inhabitants.
According to Eurostat, in 2010 there were 1.27 million foreign-born residents in Austria, corresponding to 15.2% of the total population.
Of these, 764,000 (9.1%) were born outside the EU and 512,000 (6.1%) were born in another EU Member State.
Statistik Austria estimated in 2011 that 81% or 6.75 million residents had no migration background and more than 19% or 1.6 million inhabitants had at least one or more parents of migration background.
13,000 Turks were naturalized in 2003 and an unknown number have arrived in Austria at the same time.
The total fertility rate (TFR) in 2013 was estimated at 1.42 children born per woman, which is lower than the replacement rate of 2.1.
In 2012, 41.5% of births were to unmarried women.
The life expectancy in 2013 was estimated at 80.04 years (77.13 years male, 83.1 years female).
The official language used in education, publications, announcements and websites is German, which is mostly identical to the German used in Germany but with some vocabulary differences.
The German language is standardized between countries of German mother tongue, i.e., Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Luxemburg and Liechtenstein, as well as those with significant German speaking minorities: Italy, Belgium and Denmark.
(The German population in Elsass-Lothringen in France has no minority rights.
) Many local dialects are spoken in Austria, and though their base is Austrian German, their corresponding speakers have certain degrees of difficulty when trying to understand each other.
Of the remaining number of Austria's people that are of non-Austrian descent, many come from surrounding countries, especially from the former East Bloc nations.
So-called guest workers "(Gastarbeiter)" and their descendants, as well as refugees from the Yugoslav wars and other conflicts, also form an important minority group in Austria.
Since 1994 the Roma–Sinti (gypsies) have been an officially recognised ethnic minority in Austria.
According to census information published by Statistik Austria for 2001 there were a total of 710,926 foreign nationals living in Austria.
Ludwig van Beethoven spent the better part of his life in Vienna.
Austria produced one notable jazz musician, keyboardist Josef Zawinul, who helped pioneer electronic influences in jazz as well as being a notable composer in his own right.
The drummer Thomas Lang was born in Vienna in 1967 and is now world renowned for his technical ability, having played with artists such as Geri Halliwell and Robbie Williams.
Billy Wilder, Fritz Lang, Josef von Sternberg, and Fred Zinnemann originally came from Austria before establishing themselves as internationally relevant movie makers.
The first Austrian film director to receive an Academy Award was Stefan Ruzowitzky.
A number of Austrian actors were able to pursue a career, the impact of which was sensed beyond national borders.
Among them were Peter Lorre, Helmut Berger, Curd Jürgens, Senta Berger, Oskar Werner, and Klaus Maria Brandauer.
Hedy Lamarr and Arnold Schwarzenegger became American as well as international movie stars.
The latter also became the 38th Governor of California.

Otto Schenk not only excelled as a stage actor, but also as an opera director.
A present-day quantum physicist is Anton Zeilinger, noted as the first scientist to demonstrate quantum teleportation.
In addition to physicists, Austria was the birthplace of two of the most noteworthy philosophers of the 20th century, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper.
Eminent physicians like Theodore Billroth, Clemens von Pirquet, and Anton von Eiselsberg have built upon the achievements of the 19th century Vienna School of Medicine.
Austria was home to Sigmund Freud, founder of psychoanalysis, Alfred Adler, founder of Individual psychology, psychologists Paul Watzlawick and Hans Asperger, and psychiatrist Viktor Frankl.
===Literature===Complementing its status as a land of artists and scientists, Austria has always been a country of poets, writers, and novelists.
It was the home of novelists Arthur Schnitzler, Stefan Zweig, Thomas Bernhard, and Robert Musil, of poets Georg Trakl, Franz Werfel, Franz Grillparzer, Rainer Maria Rilke, Adalbert Stifter, Karl Kraus and children's author Eva Ibbotson.
It is famous for its well-balanced variations of beef and pork and countless variations of vegetables.
Typical Austrian dishes include Wiener Schnitzel, Schweinsbraten, Kaiserschmarren, Knödel, Sachertorte and Tafelspitz.
There are also Kärntner Kasnudeln, which are pockets of dough filled with Topfen, potatoes, herbs and peppermint which are boiled and served with a butter sauce.
Kasnudeln are traditionally served with a salad.
The candy Pez was invented in Austria, as well as Mannerschnitten.
Austria is also famous for its Mozartkugeln and its coffee tradition.
At holidays like Christmas and Easter bock beer is also available.
The Grüner Veltliner grape provides some of Austria's most notable white wines and Zweigelt is the most widely planted red wine grape.
Schnapps of typically up to 60% alcohol or fruit brandy is drunk, which in Austria is made from a variety of fruits, for example apricots and rowanberries.
The produce of small private schnapps distilleries, of which there are around 20,000 in Austria, is known as "Selbstgebrannter" or "Hausbrand".
A popular team sport in Austria is football, which is governed by the Austrian Football Association.
Austria was among the most successful football playing nations on the European continent placing 4th at the 1934 FIFA World Cup, 3rd at the 1954 FIFA World Cup and 7th at the 1978 FIFA World Cup.
Besides football, Austria also has professional national leagues for most major team sports, including the Austrian Hockey League for ice hockey, and the Österreichische Basketball Bundesliga for basketball.
Horseback riding is also popular; the famed Spanish Riding School of Vienna is located in Vienna.

==Origin==A precedent for trying those accused of war crimes had been set at the end of World War I in the Leipzig War Crimes Trials held in May to July 1921 before the "Reichsgericht" (German Supreme Court) in Leipzig, although these had been on a very limited scale and largely regarded as ineffectual.
British War Cabinet documents, released on 2 January 2006, showed that as early as December 1944, the Cabinet had discussed their policy for the punishment of the leading Nazis if captured.
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had then advocated a policy of summary execution in some circumstances, with the use of an Act of Attainder to circumvent legal obstacles, being dissuaded from this only by talks with US and Soviet leaders later in the war.
US President Franklin D. Roosevelt joked that perhaps 49,000 would do.
However, he also stated that war criminals must pay for their crimes and that in accordance with the Moscow Document which he himself had written, they should be tried at the places where the crimes were committed.
Roosevelt initially supported this plan, and managed to convince Churchill to support it in a less drastic form.
The demise of the Morgenthau Plan created the need for an alternative method of dealing with the Nazi leadership.
The plan for the "Trial of European War Criminals" was drafted by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and the War Department.
Following Roosevelt's death in April 1945, the new president, Harry S. Truman, gave strong approval for a judicial process.
After a series of negotiations between Britain, the US, Soviet Union and France, details of the trial were worked out.
The trials were to commence on 20 November 1945, in the Bavarian city of Nuremberg.

The city was also provisional capital of the National Transitional Council.
===Education===The oldest university in Libya is the University of Libya, founded by royal decree in 1955.
It was later split and became known as University of Benghazi.
Béchar has a total of 33,245 houses, of which 25,499 are occupied, giving an occupation rate of 6.5 inhabitants per occupied building.
It is served by a narrow gauge railway station of SNTF, which in 2008, may be replaced with a standard gauge railway.
8.3% of the population has a tertiary education, and another 23.0% has competed secondary education.
The overall literacy rate is 86.4%, and is 91.4% among males and 81.4% among females.
A member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan has served as a non-permanent Security Council member for a total of 20 years, most recently for 2009 and 2010.
It is one of the G4 nations seeking permanent membership in the Security Council.
Japan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors: with Russia over the South Kuril Islands, with South Korea over the Liancourt Rocks, with China and Taiwan over the Senkaku Islands, and with China over the EEZ around Okinotorishima.
Japan maintains one of the largest military budgets of any country in the world.
Japan's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes.
It is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF), the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF).
==Geography==Japan has a total of 6,852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of East Asia.
The Ryukyu Islands, which includes Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu.
Together they are often known as the Japanese Archipelago.
About 73 percent of Japan is forested, mountainous, and unsuitable for agricultural, industrial, or residential use.
As a result, the habitable zones, mainly located in coastal areas, have extremely high population densities.
Japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.
The islands of Japan are located in a volcanic zone on the Pacific Ring of Fire.
They are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-Silurian to the Pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the continental Amurian Plate and Okinawa Plate to the south, and subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Okhotsk Plate to the north.
Japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent.
The subducting plates pulled Japan eastward, opening the Sea of Japan around 15 million years ago.
Japan has 108 active volcanoes.
The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people.
More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, a 9.0-magnitude quake which hit Japan on March 11, 2011, and triggered a large tsunami.
===Environment===In the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s.
Responding to rising concern about the problem, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970.
The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.
As a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol, and host of the 1997 conference that created it, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change.
The period of overall real economic growth from the 1960s to the 1980s has been called the Japanese post-war economic miracle: it averaged 7.5 percent in the 1960s and 1970s, and 3.2 percent in the 1980s and early 1990s.
The economy showed strong signs of recovery after 2005; GDP growth for that year was 2.8 percent, surpassing the growth rates of the US and European Union during the same period.
, Japan is the third largest national economy in the world, after the United States and China, in terms of nominal GDP, and the fourth largest national economy in the world, after the United States, China and India, in terms of purchasing power parity.
, Japan's public debt was more than 200 percent of its annual gross domestic product, the second largest of any nation in the world.
Housing in Japan is characterized by limited land supply in urban areas.
Japan's exports amounted to US$4,210 per capita in 2005. , Japan's main export markets were China (18.1 percent), the United States (17.8 percent), South Korea (7.7 percent), Thailand (5.5 percent) and Hong Kong (5.1 percent).
Japan's main import markets were China (21.3 percent), the US (8.8 percent), Australia (6.4 percent), Saudi Arabia (6.2 percent), United Arab Emirates (5.0 percent), South Korea (4.6 percent) and Qatar (4.0 percent).
, Japan was home to 326 companies from the Forbes Global 2000 or 16.3 percent.
In 2013, it was announced that Japan would be importing shale natural gas.
It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kibo) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008.
===Infrastructure===, 46.1 percent of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 21.3 percent from coal, 21.4 percent from natural gas, 4.0 percent from nuclear power, and 3.3 percent from hydropower.
Given its heavy dependence on imported energy, Japan has aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.
Japan was a venue of the Intercontinental Cup from 1981 to 2004 and co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea.

Later, quantum field theory unified quantum mechanics and special relativity.
Weaving was still unknown at the time and clothes were often made of furs.
The Jōmon people started to make clay vessels, decorated with patterns made by impressing the wet clay with braided or unbraided cord and sticks.
The nominees are not publicly named, nor are they told that they are being considered for the prize.
Of the various states, Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla grew to control the peninsula as Three Kingdoms of Korea.
The unification of the Three Kingdoms by Silla in 676 led to the North South States Period, in which much of the Korean Peninsula was controlled by Unified Silla, while Balhae succeeded to have the control of northern parts of Goguryeo.
Relationships between Korea and China remained relatively peaceful during this time.
During its height, Balhae controlled most of Manchuria and parts of Russian Far East.
After nearly 30 years of war, Goryeo continued to rule Korea, though as a tributary ally to the Mongols.
King Taejo declared the new name of Korea as "Joseon" in reference to Gojoseon, and moved the capital to Hanseong (old name of Seoul).
The first 200 years of the Joseon Dynasty were marked by relative peace and saw the creation of Hangul by King Sejong the Great in the 15th century and the rise in influence of Confucianism in the country.
Between 1592 and 1598, Japan invaded Korea.
In the 1620s and 1630s, Joseon suffered from invasions by the Manchu which eventually extended to China as well.
After another series of wars against Manchuria, Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace.
However, the latter years of the Joseon Dynasty were marked by a dependence on China for external affairs and isolation from the outside world.
During the 19th century, Korea's isolationist policy earned it the name the "Hermit Kingdom".
The Joseon Dynasty tried to protect itself against Western imperialism, but was eventually forced to open trade.
At the end of World War II, the Japanese surrendered to Soviet and U.S. forces who occupied the northern and southern halves of Korea, respectively.
===After the division===Despite the initial plan of a unified Korea in the 1943 Cairo Declaration, escalating Cold War antagonism between the Soviet Union and the United States eventually led to the establishment of separate governments, each with its own ideology, leading to Korea's division into two political entities in 1948: North Korea and South Korea.
==Government==Under its current constitution the state is sometimes referred to as the Sixth Republic of South Korea.
Like many democratic states, South Korea has a government divided into three branches: executive, judicial, and legislative.
South Korea is a constitutional democracy.
The South Korean government's structure is determined by the Constitution of the Republic of Korea.
This document has been revised several times since its first promulgation in 1948 at independence.
However, it has retained many broad characteristics and with the exception of the short-lived Second Republic of South Korea, the country has always had a presidential system with an independent chief executive.
The first direct election was also held in 1948.
Although South Korea experienced a series of military dictatorships from the 1960s up until the 1980s, it has since developed into a successful liberal democracy.
The country has also been a member of the United Nations since 1991, when it became a member state at the same time as North Korea.
It has also developed links with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as both a member of "ASEAN Plus three," a body of observers, and the East Asia Summit (EAS).
In 2010, South Korea and the European Union concluded a free trade agreement (FTA) to reduce trade barriers.
South Korea is also negotiating a Free Trade Agreement with Canada, and another with New Zealand.
In November 2009 South Korea joined the OECD Development Assistance Committee, marking the first time a former aid recipient country joined the group as a donor member.
South Korea hosted the G-20 Summit in Seoul in November 2010.
===China===Historically, Korea has had close relations with China.
Before the formation of South Korea, Korean independence fighters worked with Chinese soldiers during the Japanese occupation.
However, after World War II, the People's Republic of China embraced Maoism while South Korea sought close relations with the United States.
The PRC assisted North Korea with manpower and supplies during the Korean War, and in its aftermath the diplomatic relationship between South Korea and the PRC almost completely ceased.
There is heavy anti-Japanese sentiment in South Korea because of a number of unsettled Japanese-Korean disputes, many of which stem from the period of Japanese occupation after the Japanese annexation of Korea.
During World War II, more than 100,000 Koreans served in the Imperial Japanese Army.
On May 27, 2009, North Korean media declared that the Armistice is no longer valid because of the South Korean government's pledge to "definitely join" the Proliferation Security Initiative.
North Korea initially threatened to sever all ties, to completely abrogate the previous pact of non-aggression, and to expel all South Koreans from a joint industrial zone in Kaesong, but backtracked on its threats and decided to continue its ties with South Korea.
Despite the continuing ties, Kaesong industrial zone has seen a large decrease in investment and manpower as a result of this military conflict.
After three years of military administration by the United States, the South Korean government was established.
Upon the onset of the Korean War, U.S. forces were sent to defend against an invasion from North Korea of the South.
In 1967, South Korea obliged the mutual defense treaty, by sending a large combat troop contingent to support the United States in the Vietnam War.
The two nations have strong economic, diplomatic, and military ties, although they have at times disagreed with regard to policies towards North Korea, and with regard to some of South Korea's industrial activities that involve usage of rocket or nuclear technology.
There had also been strong anti-American sentiment during certain periods, which has largely moderated in the modern day.
In 2007, a free trade agreement known as the Republic of Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) was signed between South Korea and the United States, but its formal implementation was repeatedly delayed, pending approval by the legislative bodies of the two countries.
It went into effect on March 15, 2012.
The South Korean air force operates 840 aircraft, making it world's ninth largest air force, including several types of advanced fighters like F-15K, heavily modified KF-16C/D, and the indigenous F/A-50, supported by well-maintained fleets of older fighters such as F-4E and KF-5E/F that still effectively serve the air force alongside the more modern aircraft.
In May 2011, Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd., South Korea's largest plane maker, signed a $400 million deal to sell 16 T-50 Golden Eagle trainer jets to Indonesia, making South Korea the first country in Asia to export supersonic jets.
From time to time, South Korea has sent its troops overseas to assist American forces.
It has participated in most major conflicts that the United States has been involved in the past 50 years.
South Korea dispatched 325,517 troops to fight alongside American, Australian, Filipino, New Zealand and South Vietnamese soldiers in the Vietnam War, with a peak strength of 50,000.
In 2004, South Korea sent 3,300 troops of the Zaytun Division to help re-building in northern Iraq, and was the third largest contributor in the coalition forces after only the US and Britain.
Beginning in 2001, South Korea had so far deployed 24,000 troops in the Middle East region to support the War on Terrorism.
A further 1,800 were deployed since 2007 to reinforce UN peacekeeping forces in Lebanon.
The United States have stationed a substantial contingent of troops in South Korea since the Korean War to defend South Korea in case of East Asian military crises.
A still functioning UN Command is technically the top of the chain of command of all forces in South Korea, including the US forces and the entire South Korean military – if a sudden escalation of war between North and South Korea were to occur the United States would assume control of the South Korean armed forces in all military and paramilitary moves.
However, in September 2006, the Presidents of the United States and the Republic of Korea agreed that South Korea should assume the lead for its own defense.
In early 2007, the U.S. Secretary of Defense and ROK Minister of National Defense determined that South Korea will assume wartime operational control of its forces on December 1, 2015.
South Korea's economy was one of the world's fastest-growing from the early 1960s to the late 1990s, and South Korea is still one of the fastest-growing developed countries in the 2000s, along with Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, the other three Asian Tigers.
South Koreans refer to this growth as the Miracle on the Han River.
The South Korean economy is heavily dependent on international trade, and in 2013, South Korea was the 8th largest exporter and 7th largest importer in the world.
South Korea hosted the fifth G20 summit in its capital city, Seoul, in November 2010.
The two-day summit was expected to boost South Korea's economy by 31 trillion won, or 4% of South Korea's 2010 GDP, in economic effects, and create over 160,000 jobs in South Korea.
It may also help improve the country's sovereign credit rating.
Despite the South Korean economy's high growth potential and apparent structural stability, the country suffers damage to its credit rating in the stock market because of the belligerence of North Korea in times of deep military crises, which has an adverse effect on South Korean financial markets.
Korail provides frequent train services to all major South Korean cities.
Two rail lines, Gyeongui and Donghae Bukbu Line, to North Korea are now being reconnected.
Express bus terminals are available in most cities.
South Korea's largest airport, Incheon International Airport, was completed in 2001.
There are also seven domestic airports, and a large number of heliports.
South Korea is the world's fifth-largest nuclear power producer and the second-largest in Asia as of 2010.
Nuclear power in South Korea supplies 45% of electricity production, and research is very active with investigation into a variety of advanced reactors, including a small modular reactor, a liquid-metal fast/transmutation reactor and a high-temperature hydrogen generation design.
Fuel production and waste handling technologies have also been developed locally.
It is also a member of the ITER project.
South Korea is an emerging exporter of nuclear reactors, having concluded agreements with the UAE to build and maintain four advanced nuclear reactors, with Jordan for a research nuclear reactor, and with Argentina for construction and repair of heavy-water nuclear reactors.
As of 2010, South Korea and Turkey are in negotiations regarding construction of two nuclear reactors.
South Korea is not allowed to enrich uranium or develop traditional uranium enrichment technology on its own, because of US political pressure, unlike most major nuclear powers such as Japan, Germany, and France, competitors of South Korea in the international nuclear market.
The US has recently been wary of South Korea's burgeoning nuclear program, which South Korea insists will be for civilian use only.
===Aerospace research===South Korea has sent up 10 satellites from 1992, all using foreign rockets and overseas launch pads, notably Arirang-1 in 1999, and Arirang-2 in 2006 as part of its space partnership with Russia.
Arirang-1 was lost in space in 2008, after nine years in service.
In April 2008, Yi So-yeon became the first Korean to fly in space, aboard the Russian Soyuz TMA-12.
In June 2009, the first spaceport of South Korea, Naro Space Center, was completed at Goheung, Jeollanam-do.
The launch of Naro-1 in August 2009 resulted in a failure.
The second attempt in June 2010 was also unsuccessful.
The government plans to develop Naro-2 by the year 2018.
South Korea's efforts to build an indigenous space launch vehicle is marred because of persistent political pressure of the United States, who had for many decades hindered South Korea's indigenous rocket and missile development programs in fear of their possible connection to clandestine military ballistic missile programs, which Korea many times insisted did not violate the research and development guidelines stipulated by US-Korea agreements on restriction of South Korean rocket technology research and development.
South Korea has sought the assistance of foreign countries such as Russia through MTCR commitments to supplement its restricted domestic rocket technology.
The two failed KSLV-I launch vehicles were based on the Universal Rocket Module, the first stage of the Russian Angara rocket, combined with a solid-fueled second stage built by South Korea.
===Robotics===Robotics has been included in the list of main national R&amp;D projects in Korea since 2003.
In 2009, the government announced plans to build robot-themed parks in Incheon and Masan with a mix of public and private funding.
In 2005, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) developed the world's second walking humanoid robot, HUBO.
A team in the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology developed the first Korean android, EveR-1 in May 2006.
===Biotechnology===Since the 1980s, the Korean government has invested in the development of a domestic biotechnology industry, and the sector is projected to grow to by 2010.
The medical sector accounts for a large part of the production, including production of hepatitis vaccines and antibiotics.
==Culture==South Korea shares its traditional culture with North Korea, but the two Koreas have developed distinct contemporary forms of culture since the peninsula was divided in 1945.
Historically, while the culture of Korea has been heavily influenced by that of neighboring China, it has nevertheless managed to develop a unique cultural identity that is distinct from its larger neighbor.
The South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism actively encourages the traditional arts, as well as modern forms, through funding and education programs.
===Art===Korean art has been highly influenced by Buddhism and Confucianism, which can be seen in the many traditional paintings, sculptures, ceramics and the performing arts.
The Korean tea ceremony, pansori, talchum and buchaechum are also notable Korean performing arts.
Establishing a harmony between man and nature was also a favorite of this time.
Because of social instability, social issues appeared as main subjects in the 1980s.
Art was influenced by various international events and exhibits in Korea, and with it brought more diversity.
The Olympic Sculpture Garden in 1988, the transposition of the 1993 edition of the Whitney Biennial to Seoul, the creation of the Gwangju Biennale and the Korean Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1995 were notable events.
Korean traditional architecture is characterized by its harmony with nature.
Traditional architecture may also be seen at the nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites in South Korea.
Western architecture was first introduced to Korea at the end of the 19th century.
Churches, offices for foreign legislation, schools and university buildings were built in new styles.
With the annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910 the colonial regime intervened in Korea's architectural heritage, and Japanese-style modern architecture was imposed.
The anti-Japanese sentiment, and the Korean War, led to the destruction of most buildings constructed during that time.
Korean architecture entered a new phase of development during the post-Korean War reconstruction, incorporating modern architectural trends and styles.
Stimulated by the economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s, active redevelopment saw new horizons in architectural design.
In the aftermath of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, South Korea has witnessed a wide variation of styles in its architectural landscape due, in large part, to the opening up of the market to foreign architects.
Contemporary architectural efforts have been constantly trying to balance the traditional philosophy of "harmony with nature" and the fast-paced urbanization that the country has been going through in recent years.
Ingredients and dishes vary by province.
There are many significant regional dishes that have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day.
Meals consumed both by the royal family and ordinary Korean citizens have been regulated by a unique culture of etiquette.
Every meal is accompanied by numerous banchan.
Kimchi (김치), a fermented, usually spicy vegetable dish is commonly served at every meal and is one of the best known Korean dishes.
Soups are also a common part of a Korean meal and are served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the meal.
The emergence of the rap group Seo Taiji and Boys in 1992 marked a turning point for Korean popular music, also known as K-pop, as the group incorporated elements of popular musical genres of rap, rock, and techno into its music.
Hip hop, dance and ballad oriented acts have become dominant in the Korean popular music scene, though trot is still popular among older Koreans.
Many K-pop stars and groups are also well known abroad, especially in other parts of Asia.
Domestic film has a dominant share of the market, partly because of the existence of screen quotas requiring cinemas to show Korean films at least 73 days a year.
===Technology culture===South Korean corporations Samsung and LG were ranked first and third largest mobile phone companies in the world in the first quarter of 2012, respectively.
An estimated 90% of South Koreans own a mobile phone.
Aside from placing/receiving calls and text messaging, mobile phones in the country are widely used for watching Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB) or viewing websites.
Over one million DMB phones have been sold and the three major wireless communications providers SK Telecom, KT, and LG U+ provide coverage in all major cities and other areas.
South Korea has the fastest Internet download speeds in the world, with an average download speed of 17.5 Mbit/s.
However, the polling did not indicate the extent to which respondents follow both sports.
The national football team became the first team in the Asian Football Confederation to reach the FIFA World Cup semi-finals in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, jointly hosted by South Korea and Japan.
The Korea Republic national team (as it is known) has qualified for every World Cup since Mexico 1986, and has broken out of the group stage twice: first in 2002, and again in 2010, when it was defeated by eventual semi-finalist Uruguay in the Round of 16.
Baseball was first introduced to Korea in 1905 and has since become increasingly popular, with some sources claiming it has surpassed football as the most popular sport in the country.
Recent years have been characterized by increasing attendance and ticket prices for professional baseball games.
The Korea Professional Baseball league, a 9-team circuit, was established in 1982.
The South Korea national team finished third in the 2006 World Baseball Classic and second in the 2009 tournament.
The team's 2009 final game against Japan was widely watched in Korea, with a large screen at Gwanghwamun crossing in Seoul broadcasting the game live.
In the 2008 Summer Olympics, South Korea won the gold medal in baseball.
Also in 1982, at the Baseball Worldcup, Korea won the gold medal.
At the 2010 Asian Games, the Korean National Baseball team won the gold medal.
Basketball is a popular sport in the country as well.
South Korea has traditionally had one of the top basketball teams in Asia and one of the continent's strongest basketball divisions.
Seoul hosted the 1967 and 1995 Asian Basketball Championship.
The Seoul Olympic Museum is a museum in Seoul, South Korea, dedicated to the 1988 Summer Olympics.
South Korea has won more medals in the Winter Olympics than any other Asian country with a total of 45 medals (23 gold, 14 silver, and 8 bronze).
South Korea is especially strong in short track speed skating.
However, speed skating and figure skating are very popular, too, and ice hockey is an emerging sport with Anyang Halla winning their first ever Asia League Ice Hockey title in March 2010.
Seoul hosted a professional triathlon race, which is part of the International Triathlon Union (ITU) World Championship Series in May 2010.
David Ben-Gurion (; , born David Grün; 16 October 1886 – 1 December 1973) was the primary founder and the first Prime Minister of Israel.
He was arrested twice during the Russian Revolution of 1905.
==History=====Prehistory===The oldest traces of human life in what is now France date from approximately 1.8 million years ago.
As a result, the Armorican peninsula was renamed Brittany, Celtic culture was revived and independent petty kingdoms arose in this region.
The last Merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace (head of household).
One mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated an Islamic invasion of Gaul at the Battle of Tours (732) and earned respect and power within the Frankish kingdoms.
In 843, under the Treaty of Verdun, the empire was divided between Louis' three sons, with East Francia going to Louis the German, Middle Francia to Lothair I, and West Francia to Charles the Bald.
West Francia approximated the area occupied by, and was the precursor, to modern France.
Over time, some of the king's vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king.
For example, after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, William the Conqueror added "King of England" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of Normandy) and the equal of (as king of England) the king of France, creating recurring tensions.
His descendants the Capetians, the House of Valois, and the House of Bourbon progressively unified the country through wars and dynastic inheritance into the Kingdom of France, which was fully declared in 1190 by Philip II Augustus.
In the end, the Cathars were exterminated and the autonomous County of Toulouse was annexed into the kingdom of France.
Later Kings expanded their domain to cover over half of modern continental France, including most of the North, Centre and West of France.
Charles IV the Fair died without an heir in 1328.
Under the rules of the Salic law the crown of France could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line.
Accordingly, the crown passed to Philip of Valois, a cousin of Charles, rather than through the female line to Charles' nephew, Edward, who would soon become Edward III of England.
During the reign of Philip of Valois, the French monarchy reached the height of its medieval power.
Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward III of England and in 1337, on the eve of the first wave of the Black Death, England and France went to war in what would become known as the Hundred Years' War.
The exact boundaries changed greatly with time, but French landholdings of the English Kings remained extensive for decades.
Like the rest of Europe, France was struck by the Black Death; half of the 17 million population of France died.
The rise of Protestantism in Europe led France to a civil war known as the French Wars of Religion, where, in the most notorious incident, thousands of Huguenots were murdered in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572.
The Wars of Religion were ended by Henry IV's Edict of Nantes, which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots.
Remembered for his numerous wars, he made France the leading European power.
French became the most-used language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, and remained so until the 20th century.
France obtained many overseas possessions in the Americas, Africa and Asia.
Under Louis XV, Louis XIV's grandson, France lost New France and most of its Indian possessions after its defeat in the Seven Years' War, which ended in 1763.
Louis XVI, Louis XV's grandson, actively supported the Americans, who were seeking their independence from Great Britain (realized in the Treaty of Paris (1783)).
The example of the American Revolution and the financial crisis that followed France's involvement in it were two of many contributing factors to the French Revolution.
Much of the Enlightenment occurred in French intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions, such as the discovery of oxygen (1778) and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers (1783), were achieved by French scientists.
French explorers, such as Bougainville and Lapérouse, took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around the globe.
European monarchies gathered against the new régime, to restore the French absolute monarchy.
As a result of this violence and the political instability of the constitutional monarchy, the Republic was proclaimed on 22 September 1792.
As a continuation of the wars sparked by the European monarchies against the French Republic, changing sets of European Coalitions declared wars on Napoleon's Empire.
His armies conquered most of continental Europe, while members of the Bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.
After his brief return from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, the monarchy was re-established (1815–1830), with new constitutional limitations.
The discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the July Revolution of 1830, which established the constitutional July Monarchy, which lasted until 1848, when the French Second Republic was proclaimed, in the wake of the European Revolutions of 1848.
He multiplied French interventions abroad, especially in Crimea, in Mexico and Italy.
Including metropolitan France, the total area of land under French sovereignty almost reached 13 million square kilometres in the 1920s and 1930s, 8.6% of the world's land.
A small part of Northern France was occupied, but France and its allies emerged victorious against the Central Powers at a tremendous human and material cost.
The interbellum years were marked by intense international tensions and a variety of social reforms introduced by the Popular Front government (annual leave, eight-hour workdays, women in government, etc...).
France was one of the founding members of NATO (1949).
Only months later, France faced another anti-colonialist conflict in Algeria.

===Law===France uses a civil legal system; that is, law arises primarily from written statutes; judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law).
Basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the Napoleonic Code (which was, in turn, largely based on the royal law codified under Louis XIV).
As Guy Canivet, first president of the Court of Cassation, wrote about the management of prisons: "Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality.
France has long had neither blasphemy laws nor sodomy laws (the latter being abolished in 1791).
Laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881.
Some consider however that hate speech laws in France are too broad or severe and damage freedom of speech.
France has laws against racism and antisemitism.
However, since the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, the State tries to prevent its policy-making from being influenced by religion and became suspicious in recent decades towards new religious tendencies of the French society: the Parliament has listed many religious movements as dangerous cults since 1995, and has banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools since 2004.
In 2010, it banned the wearing of face-covering Islamic veils in public.
As some have complained that they have suffered from discrimination thus, and after criticism by human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, these laws remain controversial, although they are supported by most of the population.
In the 1960s, France sought to exclude the British from the European unification process, seeking to build its own standing in continental Europe.
However, since 1904, France has maintained an "Entente cordiale" with the United Kingdom, and there has been a strengthening of links between the countries, especially militarily.
France is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), but under President de Gaulle, it excluded itself from the joint military command to protest the special relationship between the United States and Britain and to preserve the independence of French foreign and security policies.

French government bond interest rates fell 30% to record lows, less than 50 basis points above German government bond rates.
====Government debt====Under European Union rules, member states are supposed to limit their debt to 60% of output or be reducing the ratio structurally towards this ceiling, and run public deficits of no more than 3% of GDP.
The French government has run a budget deficit each year since the early 1970s.

In early 1949, the war was winding down in Israel's favor, and Arafat returned to Cairo from a lack of logistical support.
Arafat continued this process in other Arab countries such as Libya and Syria.
After the passengers were moved to other locations, three of the planes were blown up.
On the same day, Arafat became supreme commander of the PLA.

In response to the closure of schools, residents organized home schooling sessions to help students make up missed material; this became one of the few symbols of civil disobedience.
In 1991, the Palestinian delegation to the Madrid International Peace Conference included many notables from Ramallah.
In the PCBS's 1997 census, the city had a population of 100,034, including 23,397 refugees, accounting for about 24% of the city's residents.
Nablus' Old City had a population of 12,000 in 2006.
In 1997, the age distribution of the city's inhabitants was 28.4% under the age of 10, 20.8% from 10 to 19, 17.7% from 20–29, 18% from 30 to 44, 11.1% from 45 to 64 and 3.7% above the age of 65.
In 1967, there were about 3,500 Christians of various denominations in Nablus, but that figure dwindled to about 650 in 2008.
Most Christians used to live in the suburb of Rafidia in the western part of the city.
In addition to that, in 2001, Nablus Speciality Hospital was built, in which it is specialized in open heart surgery, angiograms and angioplasties.
==Municipal services==In 1997, 99.7% of Nablus' 18,003 households were connected to electricity through a public network.
The water network was established in 1932 by the British authorities and is fed by water from four nearby wells: Deir Sharaf, Far'a, al-Badan and Audala.

===Corruption===A poll conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research revealed that 71% of Palestinians believe there is corruption in the Palestinian Authority institutions in the West Bank, and 57% say there is corruption in the institutions of the dismissed Palestinian government in the Gaza Strip.
34% say that there is no freedom of the press in the West Bank, 21% say that there is press freedom in the West Bank, and 41% say there is to a certain extent.
29% of Palestinians say people in the West Bank can criticize the government in the West Bank without fear.
The Palestinian Investment Fund, for example, was intended to serve the interests of the Palestinian population and was supposed to be transparent, accountable, and independent of the Palestinian political leadership.

After a power struggle with the board of directors in 1985, Jobs left Apple and founded NeXT, a computer platform development company specializing in the higher-education and business markets.
Jobs was also a fan of The Beatles.
According to reports, he kept a 1966 BMW R60/2 motorcycle in the living room of the Jackling House, and let Bill Clinton use it in 1998.
Clinton returned the favor and Jobs, who was a Democratic donor, slept in the Lincoln bedroom of the White House.
During Jobs's absence, Tim Cook, head of worldwide sales and operations at Apple, ran the company.
Ohio's neighbors are Pennsylvania to the east, Michigan to the northwest, Ontario Canada, to the north, Indiana to the west, Kentucky on the south, and West Virginia on the southeast.
After the devastation of epidemics and war in the mid-17th century, which largely emptied the Ohio country of indigenous people by the mid-to-late 17th century, the land gradually became repopulated by the mostly Algonquian-speaking descendants of its ancient inhabitants, that is, descendants of the Adena, Hopewell, and Mississippian cultures.
By the 18th century, they were part of a larger global economy brought about by European entry into the fur trade.
The indigenous nations to inhabit Ohio in the historical period included the Miamis (a large confederation); Wyandots (made up of refugees, especially from the fractured Huron confederacy); Delawares (pushed west from their historic homeland in New Jersey); Shawnees (also pushed west, although they may have been descended from the Fort Ancient people of Ohio); Ottawas (more commonly associated with the upper Great Lakes region); Mingos (like the Wyandot, a group recently formed of refugees from Iroquois); and Eries (gradually absorbed into the new, multi-ethnic "republics," namely the Wyandot).
Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes region of the Midwestern United States.
The state has the longest freshwater coastline of any political subdivision in the world, being bounded by four of the five Great Lakes, plus Lake Saint Clair.
The Roman Catholic Church was the only organized religion in Michigan until the 19th century, reflecting the territory's French colonial roots.
It is now the measurement unit used officially for expressing distances between geographical places on land in most of the world; notable exceptions are the United States and the United Kingdom where the statute mile is the official unit used.

The diameter of the Sun is about 109 times that of Earth, and it has a mass about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.
The solar constant is equal to approximately (watts per square meter) at a distance of one astronomical unit (AU) from the Sun (that is, on or near Earth).
Only 0.8% of the energy generated in the Sun comes from the CNO cycle.
Because this reaction uses four free protons (hydrogen nuclei), it converts about 3.7 protons to alpha particles (helium nuclei) every second (out of a total of ~8.9 free protons in the Sun), or about 6.2 kg/s.
At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/6,000th the density of air at sea level).
In the upper part of the chromosphere helium becomes partially ionized.
The low corona, near the surface of the Sun, has a particle density around 1015–1016 m−3.
Turbulence and dynamic forces in the heliosphere cannot affect the shape of the solar corona within, because the information can only travel at the speed of Alfvén waves.
The interplanetary magnetic field is much stronger than the dipole component of the solar magnetic field.
These could provide a better explanation of the ice ages than the Milankovitch cycles.
===Formation===The Sun was formed about 4.57 billion years ago from the collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars.
This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed.
The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main-sequence star.
However, the geological record demonstrates that Earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history, and that the young Earth was somewhat warmer than it is today.
The consensus among scientists is that the atmosphere of the young Earth contained much larger quantities of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane and/or ammonia) than are present today, which trapped enough heat to compensate for the smaller amount of solar energy reaching it.
===Early understanding===Like other natural phenomena, the Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures throughout human history.
In 1666, Isaac Newton observed the Sun's light using a prism, and showed that it was made up of light of many colors.
In the early years of the modern scientific era, the source of the Sun's energy was a significant puzzle.
In 1890 Joseph Lockyer, who discovered helium in the solar spectrum, proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the Sun.
One of the most important solar missions to date has been the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, jointly built by the European Space Agency and NASA and launched on 2 December 1995.
Hungary ( , formally, until 2012, the Republic of Hungary ( ) is a landlocked country in Central Europe.
The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight.
Primary properties of visible light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum, and polarisation, while its speed in a vacuum, 299,792,458 meters per second, is one of the fundamental constants of nature.
The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics.
==Light sources==There are many sources of light.
A simple thermal source is sunlight, the radiation emitted by the chromosphere of the Sun at around 6,000 Kelvin peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted in wavelength units and roughly 44% of sunlight energy that reaches the ground is visible.
Another example is incandescent light bulbs, which emit only around 10% of their energy as visible light and the remainder as infrared.
A common thermal light source in history is the glowing solid particles in flames, but these also emit most of their radiation in the infrared, and only a fraction in the visible spectrum.
The peak of the blackbody spectrum is in the deep infrared, at about 10 micrometer wavelength, for relatively cool objects like human beings.
As the temperature increases, the peak shifts to shorter wavelengths, producing first a red glow, then a white one, and finally a blue-white colour as the peak moves out of the visible part of the spectrum and into the ultraviolet.
Blue-white thermal emission is not often seen, except in stars (the commonly seen pure-blue colour in a gas flame or a welder's torch is in fact due to molecular emission, notably by CH radicals (emitting a wavelength band around 425 nm, and is not seen in stars or pure thermal radiation).
The climate varies from tropical in the lowlands to temperate in the mountains.
The central and southern regions are relatively hotter and less humid than the northern coast.
Like other countries in the region, Honduras contains vast biological resources.
The country hosts more than 6,000 species of vascular plants, of which 630 (described so far) are orchids; around 250 reptiles and amphibians, more than 700 bird species, and 110 mammal species, half of them being bats.
It is estimated that there are more than 1.2 million people who are unemployed, the rate of unemployment standing at 27.9%.
After years of decline against the U.S. dollar, lempira recently stabilized at around 19 lempiras per dollar.
On 7 December 2006, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Energy announced the first phase of the Secure Freight Initiative, an unprecedented effort to build upon existing port security measures by enhancing the U.S. government’s authority to scan containers from overseas for nuclear and radiological materials to better assess the risk of inbound containers.
The initial phase of Secure Freight involves the deployment of nuclear detection and other devices to six foreign ports: Port Qasim in Pakistan; Puerto Cortes in Honduras; Southampton in the United Kingdom; Port Salalah in Oman; Port of Singapore; and the Gamman Terminal at Port Busan in Korea.
Since early 2007, containers from these ports have been scanned for radiation and other risk factors before they are allowed to depart for the United States.
It contains five blue stars representing the five states of the Central American Union.
The middle star represents Honduras, located in the center of the Central American Union.
It is an equilateral triangle, at the base is a volcano between three castles, over which is a rainbow and the sun shining.
It is one of two species of deer that live in Honduras.
The exact moment is dependent on the geographical longitude, and to a lesser extent on the time of the year.
This rule gives an average year length of 365.25 days.
Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested many times, it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations, performed by Galileo Galilei.
These schemes, which were based on geometry rather than the arithmetic of the Babylonians, would eventually eclipse the Babylonians' theories in complexity and comprehensiveness, and account for most of the astronomical movements observed from Earth with the naked eye.
These bodies shared the same region of space between Mars and Jupiter (the asteroid belt), and had a much smaller mass; as a result they were reclassified as "asteroids".
=== 20th century ===In the 20th century, Pluto was discovered.
The discovery of extrasolar planets led to another ambiguity in defining a planet: the point at which a planet becomes a star.
In the Solar System, the reference plane is the plane of Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic.
The eight planets of the Solar System all lie very close to the ecliptic; comets and Kuiper belt objects like Pluto are at far more extreme angles to it.
The varying amount of light and heat received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather patterns for each half of the planet.
Its mass is roughly half that of the planet Mercury.
In 2004, a team of astronomers in Hawaii observed an extrasolar planet around the star HD 179949, which appeared to be creating a sunspot on the surface of its parent star.
=== Secondary characteristics ===Several planets or dwarf planets in the Solar System (such as Neptune and Pluto) have orbital periods that are in resonance with each other or with smaller bodies (this is also common in satellite systems).
The mechanism of CD4+ T cell depletion differs in the acute and chronic phases.
Although the symptoms of immune deficiency characteristic of AIDS do not appear for years after a person is infected, the bulk of CD4+ T cell loss occurs during the first weeks of infection, especially in the intestinal mucosa, which harbors the majority of the lymphocytes found in the body.
October ( ) is the tenth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian Calendars and one of seven months with a length of 31 days.
Following his death in 1970, President Sadat turned this around quickly into an open and close friendship.
*2004 – The cornerstone of the Freedom Tower is laid on the site of the World Trade Center in New York City.

The average diameter of the reference spheroid is about , which is approximately 40,000 km/π, because the meter was originally defined as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole through Paris, France.
The geochemist F. W. Clarke calculated that a little more than 47% of Earth's crust consists of oxygen.
The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific, and has an estimated age of about .
The third form of rock material found on Earth is metamorphic rock, which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both.
Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.
It has a composition of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with trace amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules.
Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms.
Due to this motion, on average it takes 24 hours—a solar day—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian.
The orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.8 km/s (107,000 km/h), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about 12,742 km, in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, 384,000 km, in about 3.5 hours.
Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise.
Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun.
Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the Milky Way galaxy and orbits about 28,000 light years from the center of the galaxy.
In the southern hemisphere the situation is exactly reversed, with the South Pole oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole.
By astronomical convention, the four seasons are determined by the solstices—the point in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the equinoxes, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular.
In the northern hemisphere, winter solstice occurs on about December 21, summer solstice is near June 21, spring equinox is around March 20 and autumnal equinox is about September 23.
The angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time.
The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800 year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year.
Because the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year.
This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere.
Some of these are non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels, that are difficult to replenish on a short time scale.
Most of the growth is expected to take place in developing nations.
By 2020, 60% of the world's population is expected to be living in urban, rather than rural, areas.
The first human to orbit Earth was Yuri Gagarin on April 12, 1961.
To the west, the same tribes might have built hunting camps to hunt winter game.
Copper finds show that there was trade with other areas in Europe, as natural copper is not found in Dutch soil.
In the second millennium BC, the region was the boundary between the Atlantic and Nordic horizons, roughly divided by the course of the Rhine.
Iron ore was available throughout the country, including bog iron extracted from the ore in peat bogs in the north, the natural iron-bearing balls found in the Veluwe and the red iron ore near the rivers in Brabant.
The King's grave of Oss dating from around 500 BC was found in a burial mound, the largest of its kind in western Europe and containing an iron sword with an inlay of gold and coral.
The area to the north of the Rhine, inhabited by the Frisii, remained outside Roman rule (but not its presence and control), while the border tribes Batavi and Cananefates served in the Roman cavalry.
The Batavi later merged with other tribes into the confederation of the Salian Franks, whose identity emerged at the first half of the third century.
During this expansion, Franks migrating to the south eventually adopted the Vulgar Latin of the local population.
Most of what is today the Netherlands became part of Middle Francia; Flanders became part of West Francia.
The latter part comprising of the Low Countries, that technically became part of East Francia in 870, although it was effectively under the control of Vikings, who raided the largely defenceless Frisian and Frankish towns lying on the Frisian coast and along the rivers.
The language and culture of most of the people who lived in the County of Holland were originally Frisian.
Wealthy cities started to buy certain privileges for themselves from the sovereign.
In practice, this meant that Brugge and Antwerp became quasi-independent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe.
Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in or their local duchy or county.
The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests, that developed rapidly.
The fleets of the County of Holland defeated the fleets of the Hanseatic League several times.
Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England.
This trade was vital, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself.
The Dutch settlement in North America began with the founding of New Amsterdam on the southern part of Manhattan in 1614.
Two years later, the Congress of Vienna added the southern Netherlands to the north to create a strong country on the northern border of France.
Government-encouraged emigration efforts to reduce population density prompted some 500,000 Dutch people to leave the country after the war.
On 14 December 1287, St. Lucia's flood affected the Netherlands and Germany killing more than 50,000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history.
The huge North Sea flood of early February 1953 caused the collapse of several dikes in the south-west of the Netherlands; more than 1,800 people drowned in the flood.
Because of the flooding, farming was difficult, which encouraged foreign trade, the result of which was that the Dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th/15th century.
To guard against floods, a series of defences against the water were contrived.
By the 13th century windmills had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level.
=====Delta works=====After the 1953 disaster, the Delta Works were constructed, a comprehensive set of civil works throughout the Dutch coast.
The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the Maeslantkering.
A main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland to once per 10,000 years (compared to 1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country).
The Delta project is considered by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the seven wonders of the modern world.
It is anticipated that global warming in the 21st century will result in a rise in sea level which, despite popular belief, will possibly not overwhelm the measures the Netherlands has taken to control floods.
Even more specifically, the Netherlands is the only country in the world actively preparing for a sea level rise.
Climate change will not only threaten the Netherlands from the sea side, but could also alter rain fall patterns and river run-off.
According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the territory of the Netherlands belongs to the ecoregion of Atlantic mixed forests.
The highest point is Mount Scenery, , on Saba (also the highest point in all the Kingdom of the Netherlands).
Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues, within both the political community and society as a whole.
The executive power is formed by the council of Ministers, the deliberative council of the Dutch cabinet.
The head of government is the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition.
Mark Rutte has been Prime Minister since October 2010; the Prime Minister had been the leader of the largest party continuously since 1973.
In the late 19th century this Dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of pillarisation, in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government.
Since suffrage became universal in 1919, the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties: the strongest of which were the Christian democrats, currently represented by the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA); second were the social democrats, represented by the Labour Party (PvdA); and third were the liberals, of which the right wing People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) is the main representative.
In the 1970s, the party system became more volatile: the Christian democratic parties lost seats, while new parties became successful, such as the radical democrat and progressive liberal D66.
In the 2002 elections, this cabinet lost its majority, because of an increased support for the CDA and the rise of the right LPF, a new political party, around Pim Fortuyn, who was assassinated a week before the elections.
In these elections, the CDA remained the largest party and the Socialist Party made the largest gains.
On 20 February 2010, the cabinet fell when the PvdA refused to prolong the involvement of the Dutch Army in Uruzgan, Afghanistan.
The creation of water boards actually pre-dates that of the nation itself, the first appearing in 1196.
The Dutch water boards are among the oldest democratic entities in the world still in existence.
The foreign policy of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments: to Atlantic co-operation, to European integration, to international development and to international law.
One of the more controversial international issues surrounding the Netherlands is its liberal policy towards soft drugs.
The Dutch army was used throughout the Dutch Empire.
After 1830, it was deployed mainly in the Dutch colonies, as the Netherlands remained neutral in European wars (including the First World War), until the Netherlands was invaded in the Second World War and quickly defeated by the Wehrmacht in May 1940.
Since the 1990s the Dutch army has been involved in the Bosnian War and the Kosovo War, it held a province in Iraq after the defeat of Saddam Hussein, and it was engaged in Afghanistan.
The Korps Commandotroepen, the Special Operations Force of the Netherlands Army, is open to women, but because of the extremely high physical demands for initial training, it is almost impossible for women to become a commando.
In April 2011 the government announced a major reduction in its military because of a cut in government expenditure, including a decrease in the number of tanks, fighter aircraft, naval ships and senior officials.
Since the 16th century, shipping, fishing, agriculture, trade, and banking have been leading sectors of the Dutch economy.
The Netherlands is one of the world's 10 leading exporting countries.
Foodstuffs form the largest industrial sector.
Other major industries include chemicals, metallurgy, machinery, electrical goods, and tourism (in 2012 the Netherlands welcomed 11.7 million international tourists).
Examples includeUnilever, Heineken, financial services (ING, ABN AMRO, Rabobank), chemicals (DSM, AKZO), petroleum refining (Shell), electronical machinery (Philips, ASML), and car navigation (TomTom).
Growth slowed considerably from 2001 to 2005 with the global economic slowdown, but accelerated to 4.1% in the third quarter of 2007.
In May 2013, inflation was at 2.8% per year.
In April 2013, unemployment was at 8.2% (or 6.7% following the ILO definition) of the labour force.
The Netherlands also has a relatively low GINI coefficient of 0.326.
On the Index of Economic Freedom Netherlands is the 13th most free market capitalist economy out of 157 surveyed countries.
One euro was equivalent to 2.20371 Dutch guilders.
Other important parts of the economy are international trade (Dutch colonialism started with co-operative private enterprises such as the VOC), banking and transport.
Amsterdam is the 5th-busiest tourist destination in Europe with more than 4.2 million international visitors.
Since the enlargement of the EU large numbers of migrant workers have arrived in the Netherlands from central and eastern Europe.
The Netherlands continues to be one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the five largest investors in the United States.
The economy experienced a slowdown in 2005, but in 2006 recovered to the fastest pace in six years on the back of increased exports and strong investment.
The pace of job growth reached 10-year highs in 2007.
Rotterdam has the largest port in Europe, with the rivers Meuse and Rhine providing excellent access to the hinterland upstream reaching to Basel, Switzerland, and into France.
The fertility rate in the Netherlands is 1.78 children per woman (2013 est), which is high compared with many other European countries, but below the rate of 2.1 children per woman required for natural population replacement.
Life expectancy is high in the Netherlands: 83.21 years for newborn girls and 78.93 for boys (2013 est).
The country has a migration rate of 1.99 migrants per 1,000 inhabitants per year.
People in the south are on average about shorter than those in the north.
Dutch people, or descendants of Dutch people, are also found in migrant communities worldwide, notably in Canada, Australia, Brazil, South Africa and the United States.
The Randstad is the country's largest conurbation located in the west of the country and contains the four largest cities: Amsterdam in the province North Holland, Rotterdam and The Hague in the province South Holland, and Utrecht in the province Utrecht.
The Randstad has a population of 7 million inhabitants and is the 6th largest metropolitan area in Europe.
Sikhs are another religious minority in the Netherlands, numbering around 12,000, mainly located in or around Amsterdam.
There are five gurudwaras in the Netherlands.
Around 10% of the population of Amsterdam was Jewish at the start of World War II.
The Dutch East Indies, which later formed modern-day Indonesia, was one of the most valuable European colonies in the world and the most important one for the Netherlands.
Over 350 years of mutual heritage has left a significant cultural mark on the Netherlands.
When the Dutch Royal Family was established in 1815, much of its wealth came from Colonial trade.
Universities such as the Royal Leiden University, founded in the 16th century, have developed into leading knowledge centres for South-east Asian and Indonesian studies.
This relatively large Eurasian population had developed over a period of 400 years and were classified by colonial law as belonging to the European legal community.
Including their second generation descendants, Indos are currently the largest foreign-born group in the Netherlands.

Richard Matthew Stallman (born March 16, 1953), often known by his initials, rms, is a software freedom activist and computer programmer.
He has been the GNU project's lead architect and organizer, and developed a number of pieces of widely used GNU software including, among others, the GNU Compiler Collection, the GNU Debugger and the GNU Emacs text editor.
In 1989 he co-founded the League for Programming Freedom.
His first experience with actual computers was at the IBM New York Scientific Center when he was in high school.
This paper was an early work on the problem of intelligent backtracking in constraint satisfaction problems.
, the technique Stallman and Sussman introduced is still the most general and powerful form of intelligent backtracking.
The technique of constraint recording, wherein partial results of a search are recorded for later reuse, was also introduced in this paper.
To prevent software from being used on their competitors' computers, most manufacturers stopped distributing source code and began using copyright and restrictive software licenses to limit or prohibit copying and redistribution.
Not being able to add these features to the new printer was a major inconvenience, as the printer was on a different floor from most of the users.
Richard Greenblatt, a fellow AI Lab hacker, founded Lisp Machines, Inc. (LMI) to market Lisp machines, which he and Tom Knight designed at the lab.
In February 1984, Stallman quit his job at MIT to work full-time on the GNU project, which he had announced in September 1983.
" Soon after, he started a nonprofit corporation called the Free Software Foundation to employ free software programmers and provide a legal infrastructure for the free software movement.
Stallman's staunch advocacy for free software inspired the creation of the Virtual Richard M. Stallman (vrms), software that analyzes the packages currently installed on a Debian GNU/Linux system, and reports those that are from the non-free tree.
In August 2006, at his meetings with the government of the Indian State of Kerala, he persuaded officials to discard proprietary software, such as Microsoft's, at state-run schools.
ATI has since merged with AMD Corporation and has taken steps to make their hardware documentation available for use by the free software community.
Stallman has also helped and supported the International Music Score Library Project in getting back on-line, after it had been taken down on October 19, 2007 following a cease and desist letter from Universal Edition.
Nasser introduced a new constitution in 1964, the same year he became president of the international Non-Aligned Movement, which he co-founded.
After the conclusion of the 1970 Arab League summit, Nasser suffered a heart attack and died.
Historians describe Nasser as one of the towering political figures of the Middle East in the 20th century.
On 12 December, the new king, Farouk, issued a decree restoring the constitution.
Nasser spent most of his spare time reading, particularly in 1933 when he lived near the National Library of Egypt.
Nasser returned to Sudan in September 1942 after a brief stay in Egypt, then secured a position as an instructor in the Cairo Royal Military Academy in May 1943.
On 12 July, he was lightly wounded in the fighting.
Negotiations between Israel and Egypt finally resulted in the ceding of Faluja to Israel.
Nasser was sent as a member of the Egyptian delegation to Rhodes in February 1949 to negotiate a formal armistice with Israel, and reportedly considered the terms to be humiliating, particularly because the Israelis were able to easily occupy the Eilat region while negotiating with the Arabs in March.
===Revolution of 1952===On 25 January 1952, a confrontation between British forces and police at Ismailia resulted in the deaths of 40 Egyptian policemen, provoking riots in Cairo the next day which left 76 people dead.
The Free Officers seized control of all government buildings, radio stations, and police stations, as well as army headquarters in Cairo.
In September, the Agrarian Reform Law was put into effect.
The Israelis re-militarized the al-Auja Demilitarized Zone on the Egyptian border on 21 September.
Simultaneous with Israel's February raid, the Baghdad Pact was formed between some regional allies of the UK.
When it became apparent to him that Western countries would not supply Egypt under acceptable financial and military terms, Nasser turned to the Eastern Bloc and concluded a armaments agreement with Czechoslovakia on 27 September.
===Adoption of neutralism===At the Bandung Conference in Indonesia in late April, Nasser was treated as the leading representative of the Arab countries and was one of the most popular figures at the summit.
Nasser was welcomed by large crowds of people lining the streets of Cairo on his return to Egypt on 2 May and was widely heralded in the press for his achievements and leadership in the conference.
He believed, however, that the UK would not be able to intervene militarily for at least two months after the announcement, and dismissed Israeli action as "impossible".
Two days later, British and French planes bombarded Egyptian airfields in the canal zone.
By the end of December, British and French forces had totally withdrawn from Egyptian territory, while Israel completed its withdrawal in March 1957 and released all Egyptian prisoners of war.
This effort achieved a measure of success, with increased agricultural production and investment in industrialization.
Nasser also decided to cooperate with the Soviet Union in the construction of the Aswan Dam to replace the withdrawal of US funds.
On 24 February, Nasser traveled to Damascus in a surprise visit to celebrate the union.
He was welcomed by crowds in the hundreds of thousands.
On 15 July, US marines landed in Lebanon, and British special forces in Jordan, upon the request of those countries' governments to prevent them from falling to pro-Nasser forces.
By moving the latter two, who were Ba'athists, to Cairo, he neutralized important political figures who had their own ideas about how Syria should be run.
In Egypt, the economic situation was more positive, with a GNP growth of 4.5 percent and a rapid growth of industry.
A similar alliance toppled the Syrian government on 8 March.
In January 1964, Nasser called for an Arab League summit in Cairo to establish a unified Arab response against Israel's plans to divert the Jordan River's waters for economic purposes, which Syria and Jordan deemed an act of war.
In 1964, Nasser was made president of the NAM and held the second conference of the organization in Cairo.
In early 1962 Nasser again attempted to wrest control of the military command from Amer.
New laws provided workers with a minimum wage, profit shares, free education, free health care, reduced working hours, and encouragement to participate in management.
With these measures came more domestic repression, as thousands of Islamists were imprisoned, including dozens of military officers.
Earlier that day, Nasser received a warning from King Hussein of Israeli-American collusion to drag Egypt into war.
Although in the preceding months, Hussein and Nasser had been accusing each other of avoiding a fight with Israel, Hussein was nonetheless wary that an Egyptian-Israeli war would risk the West Bank's occupation by Israel.
Amer committed suicide on 14 September.
He also advised Arafat to think of peace with Israel and the establishment of a Palestinian state comprising the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
The war resumed in March 1969.
Nasser had initially rejected the plan, but conceded under pressure from the Soviet Union, which feared that escalating regional conflict could drag it into a war with the US.
The state of Nasser's health was not known to the public prior to his death.
Following the announcement of Nasser's death, Egypt and the Arab world were in a state of shock.
All Arab heads of state attended, with the exception of Saudi King Faisal.
The general Arab reaction was one of mourning, with thousands of people pouring onto the streets of major cities throughout the Arab world.
Over a dozen people were killed in Beirut as a result of the chaos, and in Jerusalem, roughly 75,000 Arabs marched through the Old City chanting, "Nasser will never die.
During his presidency, ordinary citizens enjoyed unprecedented access to housing, education, jobs, health services and nourishment, as well as other forms of social welfare, while feudalistic influence waned.
However, the marked economic growth of the early 1960s took a downturn for the remainder of the decade, only recovering in 1970.
Sabahi came in third place during the 2012 presidential election.
He is also considered a champion of social justice in Egypt.
Also in 1969, Colonel Gaafar Nimeiry, a supporter of Nasser, took power in Sudan.
He suffered two major heart attacks (in 1966 and 1969), and was on bed rest for six weeks after the second episode.
State media reported that Nasser's absence from the public view at that time was a result of influenza.

Marx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history.
In October 1836 he arrived in Berlin, matriculating in the university's faculty of law and renting a room in the Mittelstrasse.
Marx's father died in May 1838, resulting in a diminished income for the family.
Marx had been emotionally close to his father, and treasured his memory after his death.
Seven years after their engagement, on 19 June 1843 Marx married Jenny in a Protestant church in Kreuznach.
Based in Paris, France, it was here that Marx and his wife moved in October 1843.
After the paper's collapse, Marx began writing for the only uncensored German-language radical newspaper left, "Vorwärts!
In "Vorwärts!
", Marx refined his views on socialism based upon Hegelian and Feuerbachian ideas of dialectical materialism, at the same time criticising liberals and other socialists operating in Europe.
On 28 August 1844, Marx met the German socialist Friedrich Engels at the Café de la Régence, beginning a lifelong friendship.
Engels showed Marx his recently published "The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844", convincing Marx that the working class would be the agent and instrument of the final revolution in history.
However, Marx needed to write down all of the details of his economic world view to further clarify the new economic theory in his own mind.
Accordingly, Marx wrote "The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts".
Later that year, Europe experienced a series of protests, rebellions, and often violent upheavals that became known as the Revolution of 1848.
In France, a revolution led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the French Second Republic.
Marx was supportive of such activity, and having recently received a substantial inheritance from his father of either 6000 or 5000 francs, allegedly used a third of it to arm Belgian workers who were planning revolutionary action.
Marx returned to Paris, which was then under the grip of both a reactionary counter-revolution and a cholera epidemic, and was soon expelled by the city authorities, who considered him a political threat.
With his wife, Jenny, expecting their fourth child, and not able to move back to Germany or Belgium, in August 1849 he sought refuge in London.
The headquarters of the Communist League also moved to London.
Such an uprising, as that recommended by the Schapper/Willich group would easily be crushed by the police and the armed forces of the reactionary governments of Europe.
Changes in society, Marx argued, are not achieved overnight through the efforts and will power of "a handful of men.
" Instead, they are brought about through a scientific analysis of economic conditions of society and by moving toward revolution through different stages of social development.
In other words, the working class must join with bourgeois and democratic forces to bring about the successful conclusion of the bourgeois revolution before stressing the working class agenda and a working class revolution.
London became the new headquarters of the Communist League.
The Society held their meetings in Great Windmill Street, Soho, central London's entertainment district.
The issues in this internal split were the same issues raised in the internal split within the Communist League.
Marx, however, lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and, on 17 September 1850, resigned from the Society.
Marx's main contact on the "Tribune" was Charles Dana.
Later, in 1868, Charles Dana would leave the "Tribune" to become the owner and editor-in-chief of the "New York Sun", a competing newspaper in New York City.
However, at this time Charles Dana served on the editorial board of the "Tribune".
Accordingly, it was popular with the broad masses of the working class of the United States.
With a run of about 50,000 issues, the "Tribune" was the most widely circulated journal in the United States.
Not only did the "Tribune" have wide readership with the United States and not only did that readership come from the working classes, but the readers seemed to be from the progressive wing of the working class.
Marx's first article for the "New York Tribune" was on the British elections to Parliament and was published in the "Tribune" on 21 August 1852.
Marx was just one of the reporters in Europe that the "New York Tribune" employed.
However, with the slavery crisis coming to a head in the late 1850s and with the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, the American public's interest in European affairs declined.
"From December 1851 to March 1852, Marx wrote "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon", a work on the French Revolution of 1848, in which he expanded upon his concepts of historical materialism, class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, advancing the argument that victorious proletariat has to smash the bourgeois state.
The 1850s and 1860s also mark the line between what some scholars see as idealistic, Hegelian young Marx from the more scientifically minded mature Marx writings of the later period.
This distinction is usually associated with the structural Marxism school, and not all scholars agree that it exists.
The years of revolution from 1848 to 1849 had been a grand experience for both Marx and Engels.
They both became sure that their economic view of the course of history was the only valid way that historic events like the revolutionary upsurge of 1848 could be adequately explained.
As time passed, they began to think that a new revolutionary upsurge would not occur until there was another economic downturn.
However, the United States' economy was too new to play host to a classical revolution.
Any economic crisis which began in the United States would not lead to revolution unless one of the older economies of Europe "caught the contagion" from the United States.
In other words, economies of the world were still seen as individual national systems which were contiguous with the national borders of each country.
The Panic of 1857 broke the mould of all prior thinking on the world economy.
Although Marx won this contest, the transfer of the seat of the General Council from London to New York in 1872, which Marx supported, led to the decline of the International.
In response to the bloody suppression of this rebellion Marx wrote one of his most famous pamphlets, "The Civil War in France", a defence of the Commune.
"In a letter to Vera Zasulich dated 8 March 1881, Marx contemplated the possibility of Russia's bypassing the capitalist stage of development and building communism on the basis of the common ownership of land characteristic of the village "mir".
" In one of the drafts of this letter, Marx reveals his growing passion for anthropology, motivated by his belief that future communism would be a return on a higher level to the communism of our prehistoric past.
He wrote that "the historical trend of our age is the fatal crisis which capitalist production has undergone in the European and American countries where it has reached its highest peak, a crisis that will end in its destruction, in the return of modern society to a higher form of the most archaic type—collective production and appropriation".
Before he died, Marx asked Engels to write up these ideas, which were published in 1884 under the title "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State".
While in Paris, he used that of "Monsieur Ramboz", whilst in London he signed off his letters as "A. Williams".
Two telegrams from workers' parties in France and Spain were also read out.
In 1970 there was an unsuccessful attempt to destroy the monument using a homemade bomb.
The other important contribution to Marx's revision of Hegelianism came from Engels's book, "The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844", which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution.
Marx and Engels's point was not only that such beliefs are at best half-truths; they serve an important political function.
Accumulation of capital shapes the social system.
Social change, for Marx, was about conflict between opposing interests, driven, in the background, by economic forces.
In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism.
Marx noted that this was not an intentional process; rather, no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.
Marx's view of capitalism was two-sided.
In contrast to other philosophers, Marx offered theories that could often be tested with the scientific method.
Both Marx and Auguste Comte set out to develop scientifically justified ideologies in the wake of European secularisation and new developments in the philosophies of history and science.
In modern sociological theory, Marxist sociology is recognised as one of the main classical perspectives.

In February 1965, shortly after repudiating the Nation of Islam and its teachings, he was assassinated by three of its members.
Bahrain has a high Human Development Index (ranked 48th in the world) and was recognised by the World Bank as a high income economy.
In 2010, about half of the government was composed of Al Khalifa family.
These moves were described by Amnesty International as representing a "historic period of human rights".
Human rights conditions started to decline by 2007 when torture began to be employed again.
Due to this, Bahrain lost some of the high International rankings it had gained before.
In 2011, Bahrain was criticised for its crackdown on the Arab spring uprising.
;Women's rightsWomen's political rights in Bahrain saw an important step forward when women were granted the right to vote and stand in national elections for the first time in the 2002 election.
Female activist Ghada Jamsheer said "The government used women's rights as a decorative tool on the international level.
In 2006, Lateefa Al Gaood became the first female MP after winning by default.
The number rose to four after the 2011 by-elections.
In 2008, Houda Nonoo was appointed ambassador to the United States making her the first Jewish ambassador of any Arab country.
In 2011, Alice Samaan, a Christian woman was appointed ambassador to the UK.
;Foreign relationsBahrain established bilateral relations with 190 countries worldwide.
As of 2012, Bahrain maintains a network of 25 embassies, 3 consulates and 4 permanent missions to the Arab League, United Nations and European Union respectively.
Bahrain also hosts 36 embassies.
Bahrain plays a modest, moderating role in regional politics and adheres to the views of the Arab League on Middle East peace and Palestinian rights by supporting the two state solution.
Bahrain is also one of the founding members of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Relations with Iran tend to be tense as a result of a failed coup in 1981 which Bahrain blames Iran for and occasional claims of Iranian sovereignty over Bahrain by ultra-conservative elements in the Iranian public.
In 1958, the municipality started water purification projects.
Over the next 30 years, the 4 municipalities were divided into 12 municipalities as settlements such as Hamad Town and Isa Town grew.
The first municipal elections to be held in Bahrain after independence in 1971, was in 2002.
The most recent was in 2010.
Bahrain also has the freest economy in the Middle East and is twelfth freest overall in the world based on the 2011 Index of Economic Freedom published by the Heritage Foundation/"Wall Street Journal".
In 2008, Bahrain was named the world's fastest growing financial center by the City of London's Global Financial Centres Index.
Petroleum production and processing is Bahrain's most exported product, accounting for 60% of export receipts, 70% of government revenues, and 11% of GDP.
Economic conditions have fluctuated with the changing price of oil since 1985, for example during and following the Persian Gulf crisis of 1990–91.
With its highly developed communication and transport facilities, Bahrain is home to a number of multinational firms and construction proceeds on several major industrial projects.
A large share of exports consist of petroleum products made from imported crude oil, which accounted for 51% of the country's imports in 2007.
Bahrain depends heavily on food imports to feed its growing population; it relies heavily on meat imports from Australia and also imports 75% of its total fruit consumption needs.
Since only 2.9% of the country's land is arable, agriculture contributes to 0.5% of Bahrain's GDP.
In 2004, Bahrain signed the US-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement, which will reduce certain trade barriers between the two nations.
Due to the combination of the global financial crisis and the recent unrest, the growth rate decreased to 2.2% which is the lowest growth rate since 1994.
Unemployment, especially among the young, and the depletion of both oil and underground water resources are major long-term economic problems.
In 2008, the jobless figure was at 4%, with women over represented at 85% of the total.
;InfrastructureBahrain has one main international airport, the Bahrain International Airport (BIA) which is located on the island of Muharraq, in the north-east.
The airport handled more than 100,000 flights and more than 8 million passengers in 2010.
Bahrain has a well-developed road network, particularly in Manama.
The discovery of oil in the early 1930s accelerated the creation of multiple roads and highways in Bahrain, connecting several isolated villages, such as Budaiya, to Manama.
To the east, a bridge connected Manama to Muharraq since 1929, a new causeway was built in 1941 which replaced the old wooden bridge.
Currently there are three modern bridges connecting the two locations.
Transits between the two islands peaked after the construction of the Bahrain International Airport in 1932.
The four main islands and all the towns and villages are linked by well-constructed roads.
Bahrain's port of Mina Salman is the main seaport of the country and consists of 15 berths.
In 2001, Bahrain had a merchant fleet of eight ships of 1,000 GRT or over, totaling 270,784 GRT.
Private vehicles and taxis are the primary means of transportation in the city.
;TelecommunicationsThe telecommunications sector in Bahrain officially started in 1981 with the establishment of Bahrain's first telecommunications company, Batelco and until 2004, it monopolised the sector.
In 1981, there were more than 45,000 telephones in use in the country.
By 1999, Batelco had more than 100,000 mobile contracts.
In 2002, under pressure from international bodies, Bahrain implemented its telecommunications law which included the establishment of an independent "Telecommunications Regulatory Authority" (TRA).
The country's connectivity score (a statistic which measures both Internet access and fixed and mobile telephone lines) is 210.4 percent per person, while the regional average in Arab States of the Persian Gulf is 135.37 percent.
The number of Bahraini internet users has risen from 40,000 in 2000 to 250,000 in 2008, or from 5.95 to 33 percent of the population.
==Demographics==In 2010, Bahrain's population grew to 1.2 million, of which 568,399 were Bahraini and 666,172 were non-nationals.
Though a majority of the population is Middle Eastern, a sizeable number of people from South Asia live in the country.
Bahrain is the fourth most densely populated sovereign state in the world with a population density of 1,646 people per km2 in 2010.
The only sovereign states with larger population densities are city states.
Much of this population is concentrated in the north of the country with the Southern Governorate being the least densely populated part.
The north of the country is so urbanised that it is considered by some to be one large metropolitan area.
There is a native Christian community in Bahrain.
Alees Samaan, the current Bahraini ambassador to the United Kingdom is a native Christian.
According to the 2001 census, 81.2% of Bahrain's population was Muslim, 10% were Christian, and 9.8% practised Hinduism or other religions.
The 2010 census records that the Muslim proportion had fallen to 70.2% (the 2010 census did not differentiate between the non-Muslim religions).
;HealthBahrain has a universal health care system, dating back to 1960.
Healthcare expenditure accounted for 4.5% of Bahrain's GDP, according to the World Health Organisation.
Bahraini physicians and nurses form a majority of the country's workforce in the health sector, unlike neighbouring Gulf states.
The first hospital in Bahrain was the American Mission Hospital, which opened in 1893 as a dispensary.
The first public hospital, and also tertiary hospital, to open in Bahrain was the Salmaniya Medical Complex, in the Salmaniya district of Manama, in 1957.
Private hospitals are also present throughout the country, such as the International Hospital of Bahrain.
The life expectancy in Bahrain is 73 for males and 76 for females.
Compared to many countries in the region, the prevalence of AIDS and HIV is relatively low.
Malaria and tuberculosis (TB) do not constitute major problems in Bahrain as neither disease is indigenous to the country.
Bahrain also has one of the highest prevalence of diabetes in the world (5th place), with more than 15% of the Bahraini population suffering from the disease, and accounting for 5% of deaths in the country.
Cardiovascular diseases account for 32% of all deaths in Bahrain, being the number one cause of death in the country (the second being cancer).
;HolidaysOn 1 September 2006, Bahrain changed its weekend from being Thursdays and Fridays to Fridays and Saturdays, in order to have a day of the weekend shared with the rest of the world.

Ebola virus disease (EVD; also Ebola hemorrhagic fever, or EHF), or simply Ebola, is a disease of humans and other primates caused by ebolaviruses.
--&gt; Signs and symptoms typically start between two days and three weeks after contracting the virus with a fever, sore throat, muscular pain, and headaches.
--&gt; At this time some people begin to bleed both internally and externally.
The disease has a high risk of death, killing between 25 and 90 percent of those infected with an average of about 50 percent.
This is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss, and typically follows six to sixteen days after symptoms appear.
The virus spreads by direct contact with body fluids, such as blood, of an infected human or other animals.
This may also occur through contact with an item recently contaminated with bodily fluids.
Spread of the disease through the air between primates, including humans, has not been documented in either laboratory or natural conditions.
Semen or breast milk of a person after recovery from EVD may still carry the virus for several weeks to months.
Fruit bats are believed to be the normal carrier in nature, able to spread the virus without being affected by it.
--&gt; Blood samples are tested for viral RNA, viral antibodies or for the virus itself to confirm the diagnosis.
==Signs and symptoms==The length of time between exposure to the virus and the development of symptoms (incubation period) is between 2 to 21 days, usually between 4 to 10 days.
However, recent estimates based on mathematical models predict that around 5% of cases may take greater than 21 days to develop.
The fever is usually higher than .
In about half of the cases, the skin may develop a maculopapular rash, a flat red area covered with small bumps, 5 to 7 days after symptoms begin.
In some cases, internal and external bleeding may occur.
This typically begins five to seven days after the first symptoms.
Bleeding from mucous membranes or from sites of needle punctures has been reported in 40–50 percent of cases.
Bleeding into the whites of the eyes may also occur.
Recovery may begin between 7 and 14 days after first symptoms.
Death, if it occurs, follows typically 6 to 16 days from first symptoms and is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss.
In general, bleeding often indicates a worse outcome, and blood loss may result in death.
Additionally they develop antibodies against Ebola that last at least 10 years, but it is unclear if they are immune to repeated infections.
The four are Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Taï Forest virus (TAFV) and one simply called Ebola virus (EBOV, formerly Zaire Ebola virus).
The genomes of the five different ebolaviruses (BDBV, EBOV, RESTV, SUDV and TAFV) differ in sequence and the number and location of gene overlaps.
In general, ebolavirions are 80 nanometers (nm) in width and may be as long as 14,000 nm.
===Transmission===Between people, Ebola disease spreads only by direct contact with the blood or body fluids of a person who has developed symptoms of the disease.
The virus is able to survive on objects for a few hours in a dried state, and can survive for a few days within body fluids.
EBOV is thought to infect humans through contact with mucous membranes or through skin breaks.
Once infected, endothelial cells (cells lining the inside of blood vessels), liver cells, and several types of immune cells such as macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells are the main targets of infection.
Macrophages are the first cells infected with the virus, and this infection results in programmed cell death.
Other types of white blood cells, such as lymphocytes, also undergo programmed cell death leading to an abnormally low concentration of lymphocytes in the blood.
This contributes to the weakened immune response seen in those infected with EBOV.
Endothelial cells may be infected within 3 days after exposure to the virus.
The widespread bleeding that occurs in affected people causes swelling and shock due to loss of blood volume.
The presence of viral particles and the cell damage resulting from viruses budding out of the cell causes the release of chemical signals (such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8), which are molecular signals for fever and inflammation.

==Nuclear weapons==It is believed that Israel had possessed an operational nuclear weapons capability by 1967, with the mass production of nuclear warheads occurring immediately after the Six-Day War.
Although no official statistics exist, it has been estimated that Israel possesses from 75 to as many as 400 nuclear weapons, which are reported to include thermonuclear weapons in the megaton range.
The Israeli government maintains a policy of deliberate ambiguity on whether it has nuclear weapons, saying only that it would "not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons in the Middle East.
Israel insisted the material was non-toxic, was to have been used to test filters that protect against chemical weapons, and that it had been clearly listed on the cargo manifest in accordance with international regulations.
The shipment was from a U.S. chemical plant to the IIBR under a U.S. Department of Commerce license.
It is assumed that the Israel Institute for Biological Research in Ness Ziona develops vaccines and antidotes for chemical and biological warfare.
It has not been possible to conclude whether Israel currently maintains an offensive biological weapons program; it is speculated that Israel retains an active ability to produce and disseminate biological weapons.
Politically an African nationalist and democratic socialist, he served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.
Mandela served 27 years in prison, initially on Robben Island, and later in Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison.
His father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa, was a local chief and councillor to the monarch; he had been appointed to the position in 1915, after his predecessor was accused of corruption by a governing white magistrate.
A devotee of the god Qamata, Gadla was a polygamist, having four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who lived in different villages.
Nelson's mother was Gadla's third wife, Nosekeni Fanny, who was daughter of Nkedama of the Right Hand House and a member of the amaMpemvu clan of Xhosa.
When Mandela was about nine, his father came to stay at Qunu, where he died of an undiagnosed ailment which Mandela believed to be lung disease.
Spending much of his spare time long-distance running and boxing, in his second year Mandela became a prefect.
There he studied English, anthropology, politics, native administration, and Roman Dutch law in his first year, desiring to become an interpreter or clerk in the Native Affairs Department.
Mandela found work as a night watchman at Crown Mines, his "first sight of South African capitalism in action", but was fired when the "induna" (headman) discovered he was a runaway.
The company was run by a liberal Jew, Lazar Sidelsky, who was sympathetic to the ANC's cause.
At the firm, Mandela befriended Gaur Redebe, a Xhosa member of the ANC and Communist Party, as well as Nat Bregman, a Jewish communist who became his first white friend.
In order to save money and be closer to downtown Johannesburg, Mandela moved into the compound of the Witwatersrand Native Labour Association, living among miners of various tribes; as the compound was a "way station for visiting chiefs", he once met the Queen Regent of Basutoland.
In late 1941, Jongintaba visited, forgiving Mandela for running away.
He later stated that he experienced no epiphany, but that he "simply found myself doing so, and could not do otherwise.
In 1943, Mandela met Anton Lembede, an African nationalist virulently opposed to a racially united front against colonialism and imperialism or to an alliance with the communists.
In July 1947, Mandela rushed Lembede, who was ill, to hospital, where he died; he was succeeded as ANCYL president by the more moderate Peter Mda, who agreed to co-operate with communists and non-blacks, appointing Mandela ANCYL secretary.
In the South African general election, 1948, in which only whites were permitted to vote, the Afrikaner-dominated Herenigde Nasionale Party under Daniel François Malan took power, soon uniting with the Afrikaner Party to form the National Party.
In 1950, Mandela was elected national president of the ANCYL; at the ANC national conference of December 1951, he continued arguing against a racially united front, but was outvoted.
In April 1952, Mandela began work at the H.M. Basner law firm, though his increasing commitment to work and activism meant he spent less time with his family.
In 1952, the ANC began preparation for a joint Defiance Campaign against apartheid with Indian and communist groups, founding a National Voluntary Board to recruit volunteers.
Although the ultra-Africanist Bafabegiya group opposed his candidacy, Mandela was elected regional president in October.
In August 1953, Mandela and Oliver Tambo opened their own law firm, Mandela and Tambo, operating in downtown Johannesburg.
The only African-run law firm in the country, it was popular with aggrieved blacks, often dealing with cases of police brutality.
In March 1956 he received his third ban on public appearances, restricting him to Johannesburg for five years, but he often defied it.
She withdrew her petition of separation in November, but Mandela filed for divorce in January 1958; the divorce was finalised in March, with the children placed in Evelyn's care.
Representing themselves in court, the accused were freed from prison when the state of emergency was lifted in late August.
===Robben Island: 1964–1982===Mandela and his co-accused were transferred from Pretoria to the prison on Robben Island, remaining there for the next 18 years.
In September 1970 he met British Labour Party MP Dennis Healey.
South African Minister of Justice Jimmy Kruger visited in December 1974, but he and Mandela did not get on.
In 1969, an escape plan for Mandela was developed by Gordon Bruce, but it was abandoned after being infiltrated by an agent of the South African Bureau of State Security (BOSS), who hoped to see Mandela shot during the escape.
He was replaced by Commander Willie Willemse, who developed a co-operative relationship with Mandela and was keen to improve prison standards.
By the late 1960s, Mandela's fame had been eclipsed by Steve Biko and the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM).
Conditions at Pollsmoor were better than at Robben Island, although Mandela missed the camaraderie and scenery of the island.
Botha's National Party government had permitted Coloured and Indian citizens to vote for their own parliaments which had control over education, health, and housing, but black Africans were excluded from the system; like Mandela, the UDF saw this as an attempt to divide the anti-apartheid movement on racial lines.
Violence across the country escalated, with many fearing civil war.
Under pressure from an international lobby, multinational banks stopped investing in South Africa, resulting in economic stagnation.
Mandela requested talks with Botha but was denied, instead secretly meeting with Minister of Justice Kobie Coetsee in 1987, having a further 11 meetings over 3 years.
In a surprise move, Botha invited Mandela to a meeting over tea in July 1989, an invitation Mandela considered genial.
Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, de Klerk called his cabinet together to debate legalising the ANC and freeing Mandela.
Although some were deeply opposed to his plans, de Klerk met with Mandela in December to discuss the situation, a meeting both men considered friendly, before releasing Mandela unconditionally and legalising all formerly banned political parties on 2 February 1990.
In September 1991 a national peace conference was held in Johannesburg in which Mandela, Buthelezi and de Klerk signed a peace accord, though the violence continued.
Dominated by the National Party and ANC, little negotiation was achieved.
In July 1993, both Mandela and de Klerk visited the US, independently meeting President Bill Clinton and each receiving the Liberty Medal.
===General election: 1994===With the election set for 27 April 1994, the ANC began campaigning, opening 100 election offices and hiring advisor Stanley Greenberg.
Mandela devoted much time to fundraising for the ANC, touring North America, Europe and Asia to meet wealthy donors, including former supporters of the apartheid regime.
The event was attended by 4000 guests, including world leaders from disparate backgrounds.
Although Mbeki had not been his first choice for the job, Mandela grew to rely heavily on him throughout his presidency, allowing him to organise policy details.
Retaining his Houghton home, he also had a house built in his home village of Qunu, which he visited regularly, walking around the area, meeting with locals, and judging tribal disputes.
They had first met in July 1990, when she was still in mourning, but their friendship grew into a partnership, with Machel accompanying him on many of his foreign visits.
===National reconciliation===Presiding over the transition from apartheid minority rule to a multicultural democracy, Mandela saw national reconciliation as the primary task of his presidency.
" He encouraged black South Africans to get behind the previously hated national rugby team, the Springboks, as South Africa hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup.
This was widely seen as a major step in the reconciliation of white and black South Africans; as de Klerk later put it, "Mandela won the hearts of millions of white rugby fans.
Dedicated in February 1996, it held two years of hearings detailing rapes, torture, bombings, and assassinations, before issuing its final report in October 1998.
Of a population of 40 million, around 23 million lacked electricity or adequate sanitation, 12 million lacked clean water supplies, with 2 million children not in school and a third of the population illiterate.
There was 33% unemployment, and just under half of the population lived below the poverty line.
In 1994, free healthcare was introduced for children under six and pregnant women, a provision extended to all those using primary level public sector health care services in 1996.
By the 1999 election, the ANC could boast that due to their policies, 3 million people were connected to telephone lines, 1.5 million children were brought into the education system, 500 clinics were upgraded or constructed, 2 million people were connected to the electricity grid, water access was extended to 3 million people, and 750,000 houses were constructed, housing nearly 3 million people.
The Skills Development Act of 1998 provided for the establishment of mechanisms to finance and promote skills development at the workplace.
Critics like Edwin Cameron accused Mandela's government of doing little to stem the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the country; by 1999, 10% of South Africa's population were HIV positive.
Mandela also received criticism for failing to sufficiently combat crime, with South Africa having one of the world's highest crime rates; this was a key reason cited for the emigration of 750,000 whites in the late 1990s.
===Foreign affairs===Following the South African example, Mandela encouraged other nations to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and reconciliation.
In 1996 he was appointed Chairman of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and initiated unsuccessful negotiations to end the First Congo War in Zaire.
Inspired by the region's economic boom, Mandela sought greater economic relations with East Asia, in particular with Malaysia, although this was scuppered by the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
Mandela faced similar criticism from the West for his personal friendships with Fidel Castro and Muammar Gaddafi.
When Western governments and media criticised these visits, Mandela lambasted such criticism as having racist undertones.
In 2000, the Nelson Mandela Invitational charity golf tournament was founded, hosted by Gary Player.
Mandela was successfully treated for prostate cancer in July 2001.
In 2002, Mandela inaugurated the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, and in 2003 the Mandela Rhodes Foundation was created at Rhodes House, University of Oxford, to provide postgraduate scholarships to African students.
These projects were followed by the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory and the 46664 campaign against HIV/AIDS.
He gave the closing address at the XIII International AIDS Conference in Durban in 2000, and in 2004, spoke at the XV International AIDS Conference in Bangkok, Thailand.
Mandela announced the formation of this new group, The Elders, in a speech delivered on his 89th birthday.
Mandela's 90th birthday was marked across the country on 18 July 2008, with the main celebrations held at Qunu, and a concert in his honour in Hyde Park, London.
In a speech marking the event, Mandela called for the rich to help the poor across the world.
In 2004, Mandela successfully campaigned for South Africa to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup, declaring that there would be "few better gifts for us" in the year marking a decade since the fall of apartheid.
In February 2011, he was briefly hospitalised with a respiratory infection, attracting international attention, before being re-hospitalised for a lung infection and gallstone removal in December 2012.
On 25 June Cape Town Archbishop Thabo Makgoba visited Mandela at the hospital and prayed with Graça Machel Mandela "at this hard time of watching and waiting".
The next day, Zuma visited Mandela in the hospital and cancelled a visit scheduled for the next day to Mozambique.
In the 1955 Freedom Charter, which Mandela had helped create, it called for the nationalisation of banks, gold mines, and land, believing this necessary to ensure equal distribution of wealth.
Mandela was married three times, fathered six children, had 17 grandchildren, and many great-grandchildren.
Makgatho's son, Mandla Mandela, became chief of the Mvezo tribal council in 2007.
Zindzi was only 18 months old when her father was sent to Robben Island.
In 2004, Johannesburg granted Mandela the freedom of the city, and the Sandton Square shopping centre was renamed Nelson Mandela Square, after a Mandela statue was installed there.
In 2008, another Mandela statue was unveiled at Drakenstein Correctional Centre, formerly Victor Verster Prison, near Cape Town, standing on the spot where Mandela was released from the prison.
In 1993, he received the joint Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk.
As of January 30, 2009 development was halted with no plans to resume its development.
However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
*1899 – Voting machines are approved by the U.S. Congress for use in federal elections.
Early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations.
It was hardly ever seen near the geographic pole, which is about 2000 km away from the magnetic pole.
The aurora can be seen best at this time, which is called magnetic midnight.
In northern latitudes, the effect is known as the aurora borealis (or the northern lights), named after the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas, by Galileo in 1619.
Its southern counterpart, the aurora australis (or the southern lights), has features that are almost identical to the aurora borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone.
It is visible from high southern latitudes in Antarctica, South America, New Zealand, and Australia.
Auroras also occur on other planets.
Similar to the Earth's aurora, they are also visible close to the planets’ magnetic poles.
Large geomagnetic storms are most common during the peak of the eleven-year sunspot cycle or during the three years after the peak.
An electron spirals (gyrates) about a field line at an angle that is determined by its velocity vectors, parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the local geomagnetic field vector B.
This angle is known as the “pitch angle” of the particle.
The distance, or radius, of the electron from the field line at any time is known as its Larmor radius.
The pitch angle increases as the electron travels to a region of greater field strength nearer to the atmosphere.
Thus it is possible for some particles to return, or mirror, if the angle becomes 90 degrees before entering the atmosphere to collide with the denser molecules there.
Other particles that do not mirror enter the atmosphere and contribute to the auroral display over a range of altitudes.
These are relatively infrequent and poorly understood.
In addition to all these, a weak glow (often deep red) observed around the two polar cusps, the field lines separating the ones that close through the Earth from those that are swept into the tail and close remotely.
They discovered that most of the light is produced between 90 and 150 km above the ground, while extending at times to more than 1000 km.
Images of auroras are significantly more common today than in the past due to the increase in use of digital cameras that have high enough sensitivities.
Due to the different color spectrum present, and the temporal changes occurring during the exposure, the results are somewhat unpredictable.
Different layers of the film emulsion respond differently to lower light levels, and choice of film can be very important.
Higher sensitivity creates issues with graininess.
Each curtain consists of many parallel rays, each lined up with the local direction of the magnetic field, consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth's magnetic field.
David Malin pioneered multiple exposure using multiple filters for astronomical photography, recombining the images in the laboratory to recreate the visual display more accurately.
Predictive techniques are also used, to indicate the extent of the display, a highly useful tool for aurora hunters.
It is possible to take excellent images with standard film (using ISO ratings between 100 and 400) and a single-lens reflex camera with full aperture, a fast lens (f1.4 50 mm, for example), and exposures between 10 and 30 seconds, depending on the aurora's brightness.
Early work on the imaging of the auroras was done in 1949 by the University of Saskatchewan using the SCR-270 radar.
* Red: At the highest altitudes, excited atomic oxygen emits at 630.0 nm (red); low concentration of atoms and lower sensitivity of eyes at this wavelength make this color visible only under more intense solar activity.
Fairly high concentration of atomic oxygen and higher eye sensitivity in green make green auroras the most common.
The excited molecular nitrogen (atomic nitrogen being rare due to high stability of the N2 molecule) plays its role here as well, as it can transfer energy by collision to an oxygen atom, which then radiates it away at the green wavelength.
(Red and green can also mix together to produce pink or yellow hues.
) The rapid decrease of concentration of atomic oxygen below about 100 km is responsible for the abrupt-looking end of the lower edges of the curtains.
Blue and purple emissions, typically at the lower edges of the "curtains", show up at the highest levels of solar activity.
It can also cause particles already trapped in the radiation belts to precipitate into the atmosphere.
Once particles are lost to the atmosphere from the radiation belts, under quiet conditions new ones replace them only slowly, and the loss-cone becomes depleted.
In the magnetotail, however, particle trajectories seem constantly to reshuffle, probably when the particles cross the very weak magnetic field near the equator.
As a result, the flow of electrons in that region is nearly the same in all directions ("isotropic"), and assures a steady supply of leaking electrons.
The leakage of electrons does not leave the tail positively charged, because each leaked electron lost to the atmosphere is replaced by a low energy electron drawn upward from the ionosphere.
The complete process, which also generates an electric ring current around the Earth, is uncertain.
This leads to a higher rate of interconnection between its field lines and those of Earth.
As a result, the solar wind moves magnetic flux (tubes of magnetic field lines, ‘locked’ together with their resident plasma) from the day side of Earth to the magnetotail, widening the obstacle it presents to the solar wind flow and constricting the tail on the night-side.
Occasionally the resulting modification of the Earth's magnetic field can be so strong that it produces auroras visible at middle latitudes, on field lines much closer to the equator than those of the auroral zone.
===Auroral particles===The immediate cause of the ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering rocket flight from Fort Churchill in Canada reveealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above.
Since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the auroral zone.
The main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000 km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere.
These electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their energy distribution, and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field.
Electrons mainly responsible for diffuse and pulsating auroras have, in contrast, a smoothly falling energy distribution, and an angular (pitch-angle) distribution favouring directions perpendicular to the local magnetic field.
Protons are also associated with auroras, both discrete and diffuse.
===Auroras and the atmosphere ===Auroras result from emissions of photons in the Earth's upper atmosphere, above , from ionized nitrogen atoms regaining an electron, and oxygen atoms and nitrogen based molecules returning from an excited state to ground state.
They are ionized or excited by the collision of particles precipitated into the atmosphere.
Excitation energy is lost within the atmosphere by the emission of a photon, or by collision with another atom or molecule:;oxygen emissions: green or orange-red, depending on the amount of energy absorbed.
;nitrogen emissions: blue or red; blue if the atom regains an electron after it has been ionized, red if returning to ground state from an excited state.
In between, some of the current connects directly through the ionospheric E layer (125 km); the rest ("region 2") detours, leaving again through field lines closer to the equator and closing through the "partial ring current" carried by magnetically trapped plasma.
Electric field probes in orbit above the polar cap suggest voltages of the order of 40,000 volts, rising up to more than 200,000 volts during intense magnetic storms.
In another interpretation the currents are the direct result of electron acceleration into the atmosphere by wave/particle interactions.
Ionospheric resistance has a complex nature, and leads to a secondary Hall current flow.
By a strange twist of physics, the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out, so most of the observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current, the auroral electrojet.
The solar wind reaches Earth with a velocity typically around 400 km/s, a density of around 5 ions/cm3 and a magnetic field intensity of around 2–5 nT (for comparison, Earth's surface field is typically 30,000–50,000 nT).
Her work resulted from data collected by the Explorer 33 spacecraftThe solar wind and magnetosphere consist of plasma (ionized gas), which conducts electricity.
The IMF originates on the Sun, linked to the sunspots, and its field lines (lines of force) are dragged out by the solar wind.
That alone would tend to line them up in the Sun-Earth direction, but the rotation of the Sun angles them at Earth by about 45 degrees forming a spiral in the ecliptic plane), known as the Parker spiral.
The field lines passing Earth are therefore usually linked to those near the western edge ("limb") of the visible Sun at any time.
The solar wind and the magnetosphere, being two electrically conducting fluids in relative motion, should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from the flow of the solar wind.
However, this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines, but less readily perpendicular to them.
Energy is more effectively transferred by temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere.
As already mentioned, it happens most readily when the interplanetary field is directed southward, in a similar direction to the geomagnetic field in the inner regions of both the north magnetic pole and south magnetic pole.
The width of the magnetosphere abreast of Earth, is typically 190,000 km (30 Re), and on the night side a long "magnetotail" of stretched field lines extends to great distances (&gt; 200 Re).
The flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with additional turbulence, density and speed in the solar wind.
This flow is favoured by a southward component of the IMF, which can then directly connect to the high latitude geomagnetic field lines.
The flow pattern of magnetospheric plasma is mainly from the magnetotail toward the Earth, around the Earth and back into the solar wind through the magnetopause on the day-side.
In addition to moving perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travels down along the Earth's magnetic field lines, gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the auroral zones.
The cusps of the magnetosphere, separating geomagnetic field lines that close through the Earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere, producing an auroral glow.
On 26 February 2008, THEMIS probes were able to determine, for the first time, the triggering event for the onset of magnetospheric substorms.
It is not well understood, but geomagnetic storms may vary with Earth's seasons.
Two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and Earth’s axis to the ecliptic plane.
As the Earth orbits throughout a year, it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) from different latitudes of the Sun, which is tilted at 8 degrees.
Similarly, the 23 degree tilt of the Earth’s axis about which the geomagnetic pole rotates with a diurnal variation, changes the daily average angle that the geomagnetic field presents to the incident IMF throughout a year.
These factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the IMF links to the magnetosphere.
In turn, this affects the average probability of opening a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach the Earth's inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras.
In contrast, static electric fields are unable to transfer energy to the electrons due to their conservative nature.
The convergence of magnetic field lines towards the Earth that creates a ‘magnetic mirror’ turns back many of the downward flowing electrons as the field strength increases.
The bright forms of auroras are produced when downward acceleration not only increases the energy of precipitating electrons but also reduces their pitch angles (angle between electron velocity and the local magnetic field vector).
It also enhances the electric current.
One early theory proposed for the acceleration of auroral electrons is based on an assumed static, or quasi-static, electric field and a consequent uni-directional potential drop.
This fact prohibits the concept of a uni-directional potential drop.
The electric field theory proposed for auroral particle acceleration is therefore highly questionable as it appears to violate a basic principle of physics.
A more credible theory is based on acceleration by Landau resonance in the turbulent electric fields of the acceleration region.
This process is essentially the same as that employed in plasma fusion laboratories throughout the world, and appears well able to account in principle for most – if not all – detailed properties of the electrons responsible for the brightest forms of auroras, above, below and within the acceleration region.
Other mechanisms have also been proposed, in particular, Alfvén waves, wave modes involving the magnetic field first noted by Hannes Alfvén (1942), which have been observed in the laboratory and in space.
The question is whether these waves might just be a different way of looking at the above process, however, because this approach does not point out a different energy source, and many plasma bulk phenomena can also be described in terms of Alfvén waves.
Other processes are also involved in the aurora, and much remains to be learned.
Such low energies excite mainly the red line of oxygen, so that often such auroras are red.
Some O+ ions ("conics") also seem accelerated in different ways by plasma processes associated with the aurora.
These ions are accelerated by plasma waves in directions mainly perpendicular to the field lines.
They therefore start at their "mirror points" and can travel only upward.
In a paper to the Royal Society on 21 November 1861, Balfour Stewart described both auroral events as documented by a self-recording magnetograph at the Kew Observatory and established the connection between the 2 September 1859 auroral storm and the Carrington-Hodgson flare event when he observed that, "It is not impossible to suppose that in this case our luminary was taken "in the act".
" The second auroral event, which occurred on 2 September 1859 as a result of the exceptionally intense Carrington-Hodgson white light solar flare on 1 September 1859, produced auroras, so widespread and extraordinarily bright, that they were seen and reported in published scientific measurements, ship logs, and newspapers throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia.
It was reported by the "New York Times" that in Boston on Friday 2 September 1859 the aurora was "so brilliant that at about one o'clock ordinary print could be read by the light".
One o'clock EST time on Friday 2 September, would have been 6:00 GMT and the self-recording magnetograph at the Kew Observatory was recording the geomagnetic storm, which was then one hour old, at its full intensity.
It is also notable for the fact that it is the first time where the phenomena of auroral activity and electricity were unambiguously linked.
This insight was made possible not only due to scientific magnetometer measurements of the era, but also as a result of a significant portion of the of telegraph lines then in service being significantly disrupted for many hours throughout the storm.
It was also later realized that large electric currents were associated with the aurora, flowing in the region where auroral light originated.
* Walter William Bryant wrote in his book (1920) that Tycho Brahe "seems to have been something of a homœopathist, for he recommends sulfur to cure infectious diseases “brought on by the sulphurous vapours of the Aurora Borealis.
The northern lights have had a number of names throughout history.
In Medieval Europe, the auroras were commonly believed to be a sign from God.
The first Old Norse account of "norðrljós" is found in the Norwegian chronicle "Konungs Skuggsjá" from AD 1230.
The chronicler has heard about this phenomenon from compatriots returning from Greenland, and he gives three possible explanations: that the ocean was surrounded by vast fires, that the sun flares could reach around the world to its night side, or that glaciers could store energy so that they eventually became fluorescent.
In the traditions of Aboriginal Australians, the Aurora Australis is commonly associated with fire.
For example, the Gunditjmara people of western Victoria called auroras "Puae buae", meaning "ashes", while the Gunai people of eastern Victoria perceived auroras as bushfires in the spirit world.
When the Dieri people of South Australia said that an auroral display was "Kootchee", an evil spirit creating a large fire.
After the Battle of Fredericksburg, the lights could be seen from the battlefield that night.
The Confederate Army took it as a sign that God was on their side during the battle as it was very rare that one could see the Lights in Virginia.
The auroras on the gas giants seem, like Earth's, to be powered by the solar wind.
In addition, however, Jupiter's moons, especially Io, are powerful sources of auroras on Jupiter.
These arise from electric currents along field lines ("field aligned currents"), generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon.
Io, which has active volcanism and an ionosphere, is a particularly strong source, and its currents also generate radio emissions, studied since 1955.
An aurora was also detected on Mars, on 14 August 2004, by the SPICAM instrument aboard Mars Express.
The total size of the emission region was about 30 km across, and possibly about 8 km high.
By analyzing a map of crustal magnetic anomalies compiled with data from Mars Global Surveyor, scientists observed that the region of the emissions corresponded to an area where the strongest magnetic field is localized.
This correlation indicates that the origin of the light emission was a flux of electrons moving along the crust magnetic lines and exciting the upper atmosphere of Mars.

This growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary open nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network.
Internet chat, whether using an IRC chat room, an instant messaging system, or a social networking website, allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day.
Some video games also use multimedia features.
In the Arts there are multimedia artists, whose minds are able to blend techniques using different media that in some way incorporates interaction with the viewer.
Another approach entails the creation of multimedia that can be displayed in a traditional fine arts arena, such as an art gallery.
Computer graphics is a sub-field of computer science which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content.
Aleppo (; / ALA-LC: "", ) is the largest city in Syria and serves as the capital of Aleppo Governorate, the most populous Syrian governorate.
Many of the current structures date from the 13th century.
We ask::What is the area under the function , in the interval from 0 to 1?
As it is, the true value of the integral must be somewhat less.
Jerusalem (; ; ), located on a plateau in the Judean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea, is one of the oldest cities in the world.
It is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
During its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, attacked 52 times, and captured and recaptured 44 times.
The Old City became a World Heritage site in 1981, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
As a result of the Six-Day War in 1967, the whole of Jerusalem came under Israeli control.
Jerusalem was declared the Capital of Arab Culture in 2009.
The unemployment rate in Jerusalem (8.3%) is slightly better than the national average (9.0%), although the civilian labor force accounted for less than half of all persons fifteen years or older—lower in comparison to that of Tel Aviv (58.0%) and Haifa (52.4%).
In 2010, Jerusalem was named the top leisure travel city in Africa and the Middle East by "Travel + Leisure magazine".
Route 60 runs through the center of the city near the Green Line between East and West Jerusalem.
Other institutions of higher learning in Jerusalem are the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance and Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, whose buildings are located on the campuses of the Hebrew University.
According to him, there is no conflict between religion and philosophy, rather that they are different ways of reaching the same truth.
So believe in Allah (as the One, Unique God), and His Messengers (including Jesus, as Messenger); and do not say: (Allah is one of) a trinity.
Currently, IUPAC defines an element to exist if it has isotopes with a lifetime longer than the 10−14 seconds it takes the nucleus to form an electronic cloud.
The heaviest element that is believed to have been synthesized to date is element 118, ununoctium, on 9 October 2006, by the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna, Russia.
Later that day, nine civilians are killed by car bombs in the village of Claudy.
===Isotopes===Naturally occurring iron consists of four stable isotopes: 5.845% of 54Fe, 91.754% of 56Fe, 2.119% of 57Fe and 0.282% of 58Fe.
Possibly the energy released by the decay of 60Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide 26Al, to the remelting and differentiation of asteroids after their formation 4.6 billion years ago.
Carbon from the oil can diffuse into the steel, making the surface very hard.
Carbon steel contains 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon.
Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1.
Throughout the universe, hydrogen is mostly found in the atomic and plasma states whose properties are quite different from molecular hydrogen.
The theory of relativity, or simply relativity in physics, usually encompasses two theories by Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity.
==Scope==The theory of relativity transformed theoretical physics and astronomy during the 20th century.
First, special relativity was published in 1905, and the final form of general relativity was published in 1916.
Third, special relativity was accepted in the physics community by 1920.
This theory rapidly became a significant and necessary tool for theorists and experimentalists in the new fields of atomic physics, nuclear physics, and quantum mechanics.
There appeared to be little applicability for experimentalists as most applications were for astronomical scales.
Theoretically, all five can decay into isotopes of element 72 (hafnium) by alpha emission, but only 180W has been observed&lt;/ref&gt; to do so with a half-life of (1.8 ± 0.2)×1018 years; on average, this yields about two alpha decays of 180W in one gram of natural tungsten per year.
The other naturally occurring isotopes have not been observed to decay, constraining their half-lives to be::182W, t1⁄2 &gt; 1.7×1020 years:183W, t1⁄2 &gt; 8×1019 years:184W, t1⁄2 &gt; 1.8×1020 years:186W, t1⁄2 &gt; 4.1×1018 yearsAnother 30 artificial radioisotopes of tungsten have been characterized, the most stable of which are 181W with a half-life of 121.2 days, 185W with a half-life of 75.1 days, 188W with a half-life of 69.4 days, 178W with a half-life of 21.6 days, and 187W with a half-life of 23.72 h. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 3 hours, and most of these have half-lives below 8 minutes.
The remnants of the Palestine Potash Company were nationalised and Dead Sea Works Ltd. was established in 1952 in its stead as a state-owned company to extract potash and other minerals from the Dead Sea.
In 1995, the company was privatized and it is currently owned by Israel Chemicals.
The World Bank estimates that a Palestinian Dead Sea chemicals industry could generate $918m incremental value added per year, "almost equivalent to the contribution of the entire manufacturing sector of Palestinian territories today".
The World Bank estimates that a Palestinian Dead Sea tourism industry could generate $290 million of revenues per year and 2,900 jobs.
The bull was a symbol of the southern Italic tribes and was often depicted goring the Roman wolf as a defiant symbol of free Italy during the Social War.
In the context of the 1848 liberal revolutions that swept through Europe, an unsuccessful war was declared on Austria.
Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a dictatorship.
===Republican Italy===Italy became a republic after a referendum held on 2 June 1946, a day celebrated since as Republic Day.
The Republican Constitution was approved on 1 January 1948.
To the south, it consists of the entirety of the Italian Peninsula and the two Mediterranean islands of Sicily and Sardinia, in addition to many smaller islands.
Italy deployed troops in support of UN peacekeeping missions in Somalia, Mozambique, and East Timor and provides support for NATO and UN operations in Bosnia, Kosovo and Albania.
Italy deployed over 2,000 troops in Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) from February 2003.
The distribution of immigrants is largely uneven in Italy: 87% of immigrants live in the northern and central parts of the country (the most economically developed areas), while only 13% live in the southern half of the peninsula.
German has the same status in South Tyrol as, in some parts of that province and in parts of the neighbouring Trentino, does Ladin.
===Religion===Roman Catholicism is, by far, the largest religion in the country, although Catholicism is no longer officially the state religion.
One of the longest-established minority religious faiths in Italy is Judaism, Jews having been present in Ancient Rome since before the birth of Christ.
In addition, there are more than 200,000 followers of faiths originating in the Indian subcontinent with some 70,000 Sikhs with 22 gurdwaras across the country, 70,000 Hindus, and 50,000 Buddhists.
Italy has more UNESCO World Heritage Sites (50) than any other country in the world, and has rich collections of art, culture and literature from many different periods.
British architect Inigo Jones, inspired by the designs of Italian buildings and cities, brought back the ideas of Italian Renaissance architecture to 17th-century England, being inspired by Andrea Palladio.
Italian opera was believed to have been founded in the early 17th century, in Italian cities such as Mantua and Venice.
La Scala operahouse in Milan is also renowned as one of the best in the world.
===Cinema===The history of Italian cinema began a few months after the Lumière brothers began motion picture exhibitions.
In a short time these first companies reached a fair producing quality, and films were soon sold outside Italy.
===Cuisine===Modern Italian cuisine has developed through centuries of social and political changes, with roots as far back as the 4th century BC.
Growing dissent against foreign influence and political repression culminated in the Iranian Revolution, which led to the establishment of an Islamic republic on 1 April 1979.
In 550 BC, Cyrus the Great from the state of Anshan took over the Median empire, and founded the Achaemenid empire by unifying other city states.
The empire had a centralised, bureaucratic administration under the Emperor and a large professional army and civil services, inspiring similar developments in later empires.
In the middle of the 2nd century BC, the Parthian Empire rose to become the main power in Iran and continued as a feudal monarchy for nearly five centuries until 224 CE, when it was succeeded by the Sassanid Empire.
===Middle Ages (652–1501)===The prolonged Byzantine-Persian wars, as well as social conflict within the Empire opened the way for an Arab invasion of Iran in the 7th century.
Gundeshapur was the most important medical centre of the ancient world at the time of the Islamic conquest.
The process of conversion of Iranians to Islam which followed was prolonged and gradual.
The mawali formed the majority of the rebel army, which was led by the Iranian general Abu Muslim.
The blossoming Persian literature, philosophy, medicine, and art became major elements in the forming of a Muslim civilization during the Islamic Golden Age.
The Islamic Golden Age reached its peak in the 10th and 11th centuries, during which Persia was the main theatre of scientific activity.
The cultural revival that began in the Abbasid period led to a resurfacing of Iranian national identity, and so earlier attempts of Arabization never succeeded in Iran.
The Iranian Shuubiyah movement became a catalyst for Iranians to regain their independence in their relations with the Arab invaders.
The Safavid era also saw the start of the creation of new layers in Persian society, composed of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Georgians, Circassians, Armenians, and other peoples of the Caucasus.
In 1729, an Iranian Khorasan chieftain and military genius, Nader Shah, successfully drove out, then conquered the Pashtun invaders.
Nader Shah's assassination sparked a brief period of civil war and turmoil, after which Karim Khan came to power in 1750, bringing a period of relative peace and prosperity.
Around 1.5 million people, or 20–25% of Persia's population, died as a result of the Great Persian Famine of 1870–1871.
On the pretext of restoring order, the Russians occupied northern Iran in 1911.
During World War I, the British occupied much of western Iran, not fully withdrawing until 1921.
In 1921, Reza Khan, Prime Minister of Iran and former general of the Persian Cossack Brigade, overthrew the Qajar Dynasty and became Shah.
He became enormously popular in Iran after he nationalized Iran's petroleum industry and oil reserves.
Arbitrary arrests and torture by his secret police, SAVAK, were used to crush all forms of political opposition.
After his release in 1964, Khomeini publicly criticized the United States government.
The Shah sent him into exile.
He went first to Turkey, then to Iraq and finally to France.
===After the Iranian Revolution (1979–)===The Iranian Revolution, later known as the Islamic Revolution, began in January 1978 with the first major demonstrations against the Shah.
A new government was formed and in April 1979 Iran officially became an Islamic Republic, after its establishment was supported in a referendum.
A second referendum in December 1979 approved a theocratic constitution.
The 2005 presidential election brought the conservative populist candidate, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to power.
During the 2009 Iranian presidential election the Interior Ministry announced incumbent president Ahmadinejad had won 62.63% of the vote, while Mir-Hossein Mousavi had come in second place with 33.75%.
Iran has one of the highest urban growth rates in the world.
From 1950 to 2002, the urban proportion of the population increased from 27% to 60%.
The United Nations predicts that by 2030, 80% of the population will be urban.
The listed populations are from the 2006/07 (1385 AP) census.
Tehran, with a population of 7,705,036, is the largest city in Iran and is the capital.
Tehran, like many big cities, suffers from severe air pollution.
It is the hub of the country's communication and transport network.
It is the centre of tourism in Iran, and between 15 and 20 million pilgrims go to the Imam Reza's shrine every year.
Another major Iranian city is Isfahan (population 1,583,609), which is the capital of Isfahan Province.
The city contains a wide variety of Islamic architectural sites ranging from the 11th to the 19th century.
The fourth major city of Iran is Tabriz (population 1,378,935), the capital of the East Azerbaijan Province.
It is also the second industrial city of Iran after Tehran.
Tabriz had been the second largest city in Iran until the late 1960s and one of its former capitals and residence of the crown prince under the Qajar dynasty.
The fifth major city is Karaj (population 1,377,450), located in Alborz Province and situated 20 km west of Tehran, at the foot of the Alborz mountains; however, the city is increasingly becoming an extension of metropolitan Tehran.
The sixth major Iranian city is Shiraz (population 1,214,808); it is the capital of Fars Province.
The ancient Persians were present in the region from about the 9th century BC, and became rulers of a large empire under the Achaemenid dynasty in the 6th century BC.
The ruins of Persepolis and Pasargadae, two of the four capitals of the Achaemenid Empire, are located in or near Shiraz.
UNESCO declared the citadel of Persepolis a World Heritage Site in 1979.
In 2004, a large share of natural gas reserves in Iran were untapped.
Of that amount, about 75% was based on natural gas, 18% on oil, and 7% on hydroelectric power.
Demographic trends and intensified industrialization have caused electric power demand to grow by 8% per year.
Iran’s first nuclear power plant at Bushehr went online in 2011.
The Ennahda Movement, formerly banned under the Ben Ali regime, won a plurality of 90 seats out of a total of 217.
In March 2012, Ennahda declared it will not support making sharia the main source of legislation in the new constitution, maintaining the secular nature of the state.
Such settlements currently exist in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and in the Golan Heights.
Israeli neighborhoods in East Jerusalem and communities in the Golan Heights, the latter of which has been annexed by Israel, are also considered settlements by the international community, which does not recognise Israel's annexations of these territories.
The International Court of Justice also says these settlements are illegal in a 2004 advisory opinion.
Settlements range in character from farming communities and frontier villages to urban suburbs and neighborhoods.
In 1932 the French moved their military academy from Damascus to Homs, and it remained the only military academy in Syria until 1967.

At first, this was a play on words, as Abba is also the name of a well-known fish-canning company in Sweden, and itself an acronym.
Adolf Hitler (; 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party ( (NSDAP); National Socialist German Workers Party).
Hitler received the final part of his father's estate in May 1913 and moved to Munich.
On 28–29 March 1938, Hitler held a series of secret meetings in Berlin with Konrad Henlein of the Sudeten "Heimfront" (Home Front), the largest of the ethnic German parties of the Sudetenland.
Britain, whose troops were forced to evacuate France by sea from Dunkirk, continued to fight alongside other British dominions in the Battle of the Atlantic.
Many scholars such as Jerome visited the school of Alexandria to exchange ideas and to communicate directly with its scholars.

The largest number of member states was 58, between 28 September 1934 (when Ecuador joined) and 23 February 1935 (when Paraguay withdrew).
Three of these members had been made Council members the day before the vote (South Africa, Bolivia, and Egypt).
Brazil was the first founding member to withdraw (14 June 1926), and Haiti the last (April 1942).
With the exception of the Kingdom of Iraq, which joined the League on 3 October 1932, these territories did not begin to gain their independence until after the Second World War, in a process that did not end until 1990.
Following the demise of the League, most of the remaining mandates became United Nations Trust Territories.
In addition to the mandates, the League itself governed the Territory of the Saar Basin for 15 years, before it was returned to Germany following a plebiscite, and the Free City of Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland) from 15 November 1920 to 1 September 1939.
The United States and Russia, for example, increasingly worked with the League.
After the First World War, Poland laid claim to Upper Silesia, which had been part of Prussia.
The conference accepted most of the League's recommendations, forcing Greece to pay fifty million lire to Italy, even though those who committed the crime were never discovered.
The Klaipėda Convention was approved by the League Council on 14 March 1924, and then by the Allied powers and Lithuania.
A League of Nations Commission of Inquiry, with Belgian, Hungarian and Swedish members, was sent to the region in 1924; it found that the people of Mosul did not want to be part of either Turkey or Iraq, but if they had to choose, they would pick Iraq.
In 1925, the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq, under the condition that the British hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to ensure the autonomous rights of the Kurdish population.
During the Polish–Soviet War, Lithuania signed the Moscow Peace Treaty with the Soviet Union that laid out Lithuania's frontiers.
As part of this treaty, the border town of Leticia and its surrounding area was ceded from Peru to Colombia, giving Colombia access to the Amazon River.
==Other conflicts==In addition to territorial disputes, the League also tried to intervene in other conflicts between and within nations.
Among its successes were its fight against the international trade in opium and sexual slavery, and its work to alleviate the plight of refugees, particularly in Turkey in the period up to 1926.
In 1930, a League report confirmed the presence of slavery and forced labour.
Under the terms of an agreed lease, the Japanese government had the right to station its troops in the area around the South Manchurian Railway, a major trade route between the two countries, in the Chinese region of Manchuria.
In 1932, Japanese air and sea forces bombarded the Chinese city of Shanghai, sparking the January 28 Incident.
The League of Nations agreed to a request for help from the Chinese government, but the long voyage by ship delayed League officials.
When they arrived, they were confronted with Chinese assertions that the Japanese had invaded unlawfully, while the Japanese claimed they were acting to keep peace in the area.
Before the report could be voted on by the Assembly, Japan announced its intention to push further into China.
The war was a disaster for both sides, causing 57,000 casualties for Bolivia, whose population was around three million, and 36,000 dead for Paraguay, whose population was approximately one million.
It also brought both countries to the brink of economic disaster.
On 5 October and later on 29 February 1936, the United States endeavoured, with limited success, to limit its exports of oil and other materials to normal peacetime levels.
The League sanctions were lifted on 4 July 1936, but by that point Italy had already gained control of the urban areas of Abyssinia.
The League members, however, would not intervene in the Spanish Civil War nor prevent foreign intervention in the conflict.
Western countries were sympathetic to the Chinese in their struggle, particularly in their stubborn defence of Shanghai, a city with a substantial number of foreigners.
In 1933, Japan simply withdrew from the League rather than submit to its judgement, as did Germany the same year (using the failure of the World Disarmament Conference to agree to arms parity between France and Germany as a pretext), and Italy in 1937.
The final significant act of the League was to expel the Soviet Union in December 1939 after it invaded Finland.
===Global representation===Representation at the League was often a problem.
In January 1920, when the League was born, Germany was not permitted to join because it was seen as having been the aggressor in the First World War.
Italy also began as a permanent member of the Council, but withdrew in 1937.
Immediately after the First World War, pacifism became a strong force among both the people and governments of the two countries.
At the 1943 Tehran Conference, the Allied powers agreed to create a new body to replace the League: the United Nations.
The designers of the structures of the United Nations intended to make it more effective than the League.
The final meeting of the League of Nations took place on 12 April 1946 in Geneva.
Paul Joseph Goebbels (; ; 29 October 1897 – 1 May 1945) was a German politician and Reich Minister of Propaganda in Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945.
Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events.
Albania (, , or sometimes , ; ; ), officially known as the Republic of Albania (; ), is a country in Southeastern Europe.
It is less than from Italy, across the Strait of Otranto which links the Adriatic Sea to the Ionian Sea.
Albania is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the World Trade Organization.
=== Executive branch ===The head of state in Albania is the President of the Republic.
The current President of the Republic is Bujar Nishani elected in July 2012.
There are 15 permanent commissions, or committees.
Parliamentary elections are held at least every four years.
The lowlands of the west face the Adriatic Sea.
The 70% of the country that is mountainous is rugged and often inaccessible from the outside.
The three largest and deepest tectonic lakes of the Balkan Peninsula are partly located in Albania.
In the southern lowlands, temperatures average about higher throughout the year.
The difference is greater than during the summer and somewhat less during the winter.
Average precipitation is heavy, a result of the convergence of the prevailing airflow from the Mediterranean Sea and the continental air mass.
Nearly 95% of the rain falls in the winter.
Rainfall in the upland mountain ranges is heavier.
The seasonal variation is not quite as great in the coastal area.
Since the collapse of the former regime, there has been a considerable increase in car ownership and bus usage.
Whilst some of the country's roads are still in very poor condition, there have been other developments (such as the construction of a motorway between Tirana and Durrës) which have taken much traffic away from the railways.
Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992.
)Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian.
The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South.
The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German.
"Meshari" (The Missal) by Gjon Buzuku, published in 1555, is considered the first literary work of written Albanian.
The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood.
The earliest evidence dates from 1332 AD with a Latin report from the French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, Archbishop of Antivari, who wrote that Albanians used Latin letters in their books although their language was quite different from Latin.
Schools were scarce between World War I and World War II.
Today the overall literacy rate in Albania is 98.7%; the male literacy rate is 99.2% and female literacy rate is 98.3%.
There are also nursing schools in other cities.
The main meal of Albanians is the midday meal, which is usually accompanied by a salad of fresh vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers and olives with olive oil, vinegar and salt.
Ukraine (; , transliterated: , ) is a country in Eastern Europe.
In 1654, Khmelnytsky signed the Treaty of Pereyaslav, forming a military and political alliance with Russia that acknowledged loyalty to the tsar.
From 1737 to 1834, expansion into the northern Black Sea littoral and the eastern Danube valley was a cornerstone of Russian foreign policy.
At a later period, tsarists established a policy of Russification, suppressing the use of the Ukrainian language in print, and in public.
Ukrainians entered World War I on the side of both the Central Powers, under Austria, and the Triple Entente, under Russia.
During the war, Austro-Hungarian authorities established the Ukrainian Legion to fight against the Russian Empire.
This led to civil war, and an anarchist movement called the Black Army led by Nestor Makhno, developed in Southern Ukraine during that war.
Scholars are divided as to whether this famine fits the definition of genocide, but the Ukrainian parliament and other countries recognise it as such.
The Communist leadership perceived famine as a means of class struggle and used starvation as a punishment tool to force peasants into collective farms.
Largely the same groups were responsible for the mass killing operations during the civil war, collectivisation, and the Great Terror.
Evdokimov transferred into Communist Party administration in 1934, when he became Party secretary for North Caucasus Krai.
All these territorial gains were internationally recognised by the Paris peace treaties of 1947.
More than 600,000 Soviet soldiers (or one-quarter of the Soviet Western Front) were killed or taken captive there.
In total, the number of ethnic Ukrainians who fought in the ranks of the Soviet Army is estimated from 4.5 million to 7 million.
By 1950, the republic had fully surpassed pre-war levels of industry and production.
As a result, the Ukrainian workforce rose 33.2% from 1940 to 1955 while industrial output grew 2.2 times in that same period.
Such an important role resulted in a major influence of the local elite.
On 26 April 1986, a reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded, resulting in the Chernobyl disaster, the worst nuclear reactor accident in history.
At the time of the accident, 7 million people lived in the contaminated territories, including 2.2 million in Ukraine.
This started a period of confrontation with the central Soviet authorities.
In August 1991, a conservative faction among the Communist leaders of the Soviet Union attempted a coup to remove Mikhail Gorbachev and to restore the Communist party's power.
However, the country experienced deeper economic slowdown than some of the other former Soviet Republics.
During the recession, Ukraine lost 60% of its GDP from 1991 to 1999, and suffered five-digit inflation rates.
The Ukrainian economy stabilized by the end of the 1990s.
A new currency, the hryvnia, was introduced in 1996.
=== Orange Revolution ===In 2004, Viktor Yanukovych, then Prime Minister, was declared the winner of the presidential elections, which had been largely rigged, as the Supreme Court of Ukraine later ruled.
The results caused a public outcry in support of the opposition candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, who challenged the outcome.
On 1 March 2014, exiled Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych requested that Russia use military forces "to establish legitimacy, peace, law and order, stability and defending the people of Ukraine".
On 6 March 2014, the Crimean Parliament voted to "enter into the Russian Federation with the rights of a subject of the Russian Federation" and later held a referendum asking the people of these regions whether they wanted to join Russia as a federal subject, or if they wanted to restore the 1992 Crimean constitution and Crimea's status as a part of Ukraine.
Meanwhile, unrest began in the Eastern and Southern regions of Ukraine.
Ukraine ratified the treaty in 1994, and by 1996 the country became free of nuclear weapons.
Ukraine took consistent steps toward reduction of conventional weapons.
It signed the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, which called for reduction of tanks, artillery, and armoured vehicles (army forces were reduced to 300,000).
Following independence, Ukraine declared itself a neutral state.
The country has had a limited military partnership with Russian Federation, other CIS countries and a partnership with NATO since 1994.
In 1991, the government liberalised most prices to combat widespread product shortages, and was successful in overcoming the problem.
The loose monetary policies of the early 1990s pushed inflation to hyperinflationary levels.
For the year 1993, Ukraine holds the world record for inflation in one calendar year.
Those living on fixed incomes suffered the most.
Prices stabilised only after the introduction of new currency, the hryvnia, in 1996.
The country was also slow in implementing structural reforms.
However, widespread resistance to reforms within the government and from a significant part of the population soon stalled the reform efforts.
In the early 2000s, the economy showed strong export-based growth of 5 to 10%, with industrial production growing more than 10% per year.
Ukraine was hit by the economic crisis of 2008 and in November 2008, the IMF approved a stand-by loan of $16.5 billion for the country.
By July 2008 the average nominal salary in Ukraine reached 1,930 hryvnias per month.
Since independence, Ukraine has maintained its own space agency, the National Space Agency of Ukraine (NSAU).
Between 1991 and 2007, Ukraine has launched six self made satellites and 101 launch vehicles, and continues to design spacecraft.
The country imports most energy supplies, especially oil and natural gas and to a large extent depends on Russia as its energy supplier.
While 25% of the natural gas in Ukraine comes from internal sources, about 35% comes from Russia and the remaining 40% from Central Asia through transit routes that Russia controls.
At the same time, 85% of the Russian gas is delivered to Western Europe through Ukraine.
Significant issues include underdeveloped infrastructure and transportation, corruption and bureaucracy.
In 2007 the Ukrainian stock market recorded the second highest growth in the world of 130 percent.
The Seven Wonders of Ukraine and Seven Natural Wonders of Ukraine are the selection of the most important landmarks of Ukraine, chosen by the general public through an internet-based vote.
==Demographics==According to the Ukrainian Census of 2001, Ukrainians make up 77.8% of the population.
The industrial regions in the east and southeast are the most heavily populated, and about 67.2% of the population lives in urban areas.
In 2007, the country's rate of population decline was the fourth highest in the world.
Infant mortality rates have also dropped from 10.4 deaths to 8.3 per 1,000 children under one year of age.
Ukraine, where total fertility (a very low 1.1 in 2001), was one of the world's lowest, shows that there is more than one pathway to lowest-low fertility.
Analysis of official national statistics and the Ukrainian Reproductive Health Survey show that fertility declined to very low levels without a transition to a later pattern of childbearing.
Findings from focus group interviews suggest explanations of the early fertility pattern.
These findings include the persistence of traditional norms for childbearing and the roles of men and women, concerns about medical complications and infertility at a later age, and the link between early fertility and early marriage.
The demographic trend is showing signs of improvement, as the birth rate has been steadily growing since 2001.
In 2007 the highest birth rates were in the western oblasts.
Protestants in Ukraine form around 2.19 percent of the population.
There are 487 registered Muslim communities, 368 of them on Crimea.
The Jewish population is a tiny fraction of what it was before World War II.
The largest Jewish communities in 1926 were in Odessa, 154,000 or 36.5% of the total population; and Kiev, 140,500 or 27.3%.
===Education===According to the Ukrainian constitution, access to free education is granted to all citizens.
Complete general secondary education is compulsory in the state schools which constitute the overwhelming majority.
Free higher education in state and communal educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis.
There is also a small number of accredited private secondary and higher education institutions.
Because of the Soviet Union's emphasis on total access of education for all citizens, which continues today, the literacy rate is an estimated 99.4%.
Since 2005, an eleven-year school programme has been replaced with a twelve-year one: primary education takes four years to complete (starting at age six), middle education (secondary) takes five years to complete; upper secondary then takes three years.
Among the Ukrainians that rose to the highest offices in the Russian Empire were Aleksey Razumovsky, Alexander Bezborodko and Ivan Paskevich.
Among the Ukrainians who greatly influenced the Russian Orthodox Church in this period were Stephen Yavorsky, Feofan Prokopovich and Dimitry of Rostov.
b.
See the Great Purge article for details.
c. Estimates on the number of deaths vary.
Official Soviet data is not available because the Soviet government denied the existence of the famine.
See the Holodomor article for details.
Sources differ on interpreting various statements from different branches of different governments as to whether they amount to the official recognition of the Famine as Genocide by the country.
For example, after the statement issued by the Latvian Sejm on 13 March 2008, the total number of countries is given as 19 (according to "Ukrainian BBC": ), 16 (according to "Korrespondent", Russian edition: ), "more than 10" (according to "Korrespondent", Ukrainian edition: ) Retrieved 27 January 2008.d. These figures are likely to be much higher, as they do not include Ukrainians from nations or Ukrainian Jews, but instead only ethnic Ukrainians, from the Ukrainian SSR.
e. This figure excludes POW deaths.
f. According to the official 2001 census data (by nationality; by language) about 75 percent of Kiev's population responded 'Ukrainian' to the native language (ridna mova) census question, and roughly 25 percent responded 'Russian'.
On the other hand, when the question 'What language do you use in everyday life?
' was asked in the 2003 sociological survey, the Kievans' answers were distributed as follows: 'mostly Russian': 52 percent, 'both Russian and Ukrainian in equal measure': 32 percent, 'mostly Ukrainian': 14 percent, 'exclusively Ukrainian': 4.3 percent.
g. Such writings were also the base for Russian and Belarusian literature.
h. Without the city of Inhulets.
The people of Uganda were hunter-gatherers until 1,700 to 2,300 years ago, when Bantu-speaking populations migrated to the southern parts of the country.
Uganda gained independence from Britain on 9 October 1962.
However, much of the south is poorly drained, while the centre is dominated by Lake Kyoga, which is also surrounded by extensive marshy areas.
Uganda lies almost completely within the Nile basin.
The Victoria Nile drains from Lake Victoria into Lake Kyoga and thence into Lake Albert on the Congolese border.
It then runs northwards into South Sudan.
One small area on the eastern edge of Uganda is drained by the Turkwel River, part of the internal drainage basin of Lake Turkana.
Southern Uganda is wetter with rain generally spread throughout the year.
At Entebbe on the northern shore of Lake Victoria, most rain falls from March to June and in the November/December period.
Further to the north a dry season gradually emerges; at Gulu about from the South Sudanese border, November to February is much drier than the rest of the year.
===Environment and conservation===Uganda has 60 protected areas, including ten national parks: Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and Rwenzori Mountains National Park (both UNESCO World Heritage Sites), Kibale National Park, Kidepo Valley National Park, Lake Mburo National Park, Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, Mount Elgon National Park, Kenya National Park, Murchison Falls National Park, Queen Elizabeth National Park, and Semuliki National Park.
It is bordered by Eritrea to the north and northeast, Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Sudan and South Sudan to the west, and Kenya to the south.
Sabaean influence is now thought to have been minor, limited to a few localities, and disappearing after a few decades or a century.
In the first century AD the Aksumite Empire emerged in what is now northern Ethiopia and Eritrea.
Aksum would later at times extend its rule into Yemen on the other side of the Red Sea.
The name of the dynasty is derived from the Cushitic-speaking Agaw of northern Ethiopia.
In the early 15th century, Ethiopia sought to make diplomatic contact with European kingdoms for the first time since Aksumite times.
A letter from King Henry IV of England to the Emperor of Abyssinia survives.
This Abyssinian–Adal War was also one of the first proxy wars in the region, as the Ottoman Empire and Portugal took sides in the conflict.
When Emperor Susenyos I converted to Roman Catholicism in 1624, years of revolt and civil unrest followed, resulting in thousands of deaths.
On 25 June 1632 Emperor Fasilides, Susenyos's son, declared the state religion again to be Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity.
Chief among these was the Yejju dynasty, which included Aligaz of Yejju and his brother Ali I of Yejju.
Menelik had signed the Treaty of Wichale with Italy in May 1889 in which Italy would recognize Ethiopia's sovereignty so long as Italy could control an area north of Ethiopia (part of modern Eritrea).
In return Italy was to provide Menelik with arms and support him as emperor.
The Italians used the time between the signing of the treaty and its ratification by the Italian government to expand their territorial claims.
About a third of the population died in the Great Ethiopian Famine (1888 to 1892).
Following Zewditu's death, he was made Emperor on 2 November 1930.
During this time, Haile Selassie appealed to the League of Nations in 1935, delivering an address that made him a worldwide figure, and the 1935 "Time" magazine Man of the Year.
Also in this period, 1937, was the Italian massacre of Yekatit 12.
Following the entry of Italy into World War II, British Empire forces, together with patriot Ethiopian fighters, officially liberated Ethiopia in the course of the East African Campaign in 1941.
Ethiopia had between two and four million slaves in the early 20th century, out of a total population of about eleven million.
Opinion within Ethiopia turned against Haile Selassie I owing to the worldwide oil crisis of 1973, which caused a sharp increase in gasoline prices starting on 13 February 1974; food shortages; uncertainty regarding the succession; border wars, and discontent in the middle class created through modernization.
The high gasoline prices caused the taxi drivers and teachers to go on strike on 18 February 1974.
Students and workers in Addis Ababa began demonstrating against the government on 20 February 1974.
A new government was formed with Endelkachew Makonnen serving as Prime Minister.
In 1977, the Ogaden War resulted in Somalia capturing part of the Ogaden region.
Ethiopia recovered it after receiving massive military aid from the USSR, Cuba, South Yemen, East Germany and North Korea.
This included around 15,000 Cuban combat troops.
Up to 500,000 were killed as a result of the Red Terror, from forced deportations, or from the use of hunger as a weapon under Mengistu's rule.
Numerous other top leaders of his were also found guilty of war crimes.
Numerous former officials received the death sentence and tens of others spent the next 20 years in jail, before being pardoned from life sentences.
In the beginning of the 1980s, a series of famines hit Ethiopia that affected around 8 million people, resulting in 1 million dead.
This resulted in more economic hardship and the collapse of the military in the face of determined onslaughts by guerrilla forces in the north.
The collapse of communism in general, and in Eastern Europe during the Revolutions of 1989, coincided with the Soviet Union stopping aid to Ethiopia altogether in 1990.
In May 1991, EPRDF forces advanced on Addis Ababa and the Soviet Union did not intervene to save the government side.
Mengistu fled the country to asylum in Zimbabwe, where he still resides.
In June 1992, the Oromo Liberation Front withdrew from the government; in March 1993, members of the Southern Ethiopia Peoples' Democratic Coalition also left the government.
In May 1998, a border dispute with Eritrea led to the Eritrean–Ethiopian War, which lasted until June 2000 and cost both countries an estimated $1 million a day.
On 15 May 2005, Ethiopia held a third multiparty election, which was highly disputed, with some opposition groups claiming fraud.
The opposition parties gained more than 200 parliamentary seats, compared with just 12 in the 2000 elections.
A coalition of opposition parties and some individuals was established in 2009 to oust the regime of the EPRDF in legislative elections of 2010.
The opposition won most votes in Addis Ababa, but the EPRDF halted counting of votes for several days.
Full recovery from the drought's effects are not expected until 2012, with long-term strategies by the national government in conjunction with development agencies believed to offer the most sustainable results.
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi died on 20 August 2012 in Brussels, where he was being treated for an unspecified illness.
Hailemariam will remain in the position until new elections in 2015.
In 2013, the mass deportation from Saudi Arabia of Ethiopian migrant workers has caused tensions.
Lake Tana in the north is the source of the Blue Nile.
The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.
===Climate===The predominant climate type is tropical monsoon, with wide topographic-induced variation.
The Ethiopian Highlands cover most of the country and have a climate which is generally considerably cooler than other regions at similar proximity to the Equator.
There are on average 7 hours of sunshine per day, meaning it is sunny for around 60% of the available time.
The dry season is the sunniest time of the year, though even at the height of the rainy season in July and August there are still usually several hours per day of bright sunshine.
Most major cities and tourist sites in Ethiopia lie at a similar elevation to Addis Ababa and have a comparable climate.
In less elevated regions, particularly the lower lying Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands in the east of the country, the climate can be significantly hotter and drier.
The African Wild Dog prehistorically had widespread distribution in the territory.
However, with last sightings at Fincha, this canid is thought to be potentially extirpated within Ethiopia.
The Ethiopian wolf is perhaps the most researched of all the endangered species within Ethiopia.
Ethiopia is a global center of avian diversity.
To date more than 856 bird species have been recorded in Ethiopia, 20 of which are endemic to the country.
Habitat destruction is a factor that leads to endangerment.
When changes to a habitat occur rapidly, animals do not have time to adjust.
Human impact threatens many species, with greater threats expected as a result of climate change induced by greenhouse gas emissions.
With carbon dioxide emissions in 2010 of 6,494,000 tonnes, Ethiopia contributes just 0.02% to the annual human-caused release of greenhouse gases.
Ethiopia has a large number of species listed as critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable to global extinction.
The threatened species in Ethiopia can be broken down into three categories (based on IUCN ratings): Critically Endangered, Endangered, and Vulnerable.
===Deforestation===Deforestation is a major concern for Ethiopia as studies suggest loss of forest contributes to soil erosion, loss of nutrients in the soil, loss of animal habitats and reduction in biodiversity.
At the beginning of the 20th century around 420 000 km² or 35% of Ethiopia's land was covered by trees but recent research indicates that forest cover is now approximately 11.9% of the area.
Ethiopia is one of the seven fundamental and independent centers of origin of cultivated plants of the world.
Between 1990 and 2005 the country lost approximately 21 000 km².
Organizations such as SOS and Farm Africa are working with the federal government and local governments to create a system of forest management.
Working with a grant of approximately 2.3 million euros the Ethiopian government recently began training people on reducing erosion and using proper irrigation techniques that do not contribute to deforestation.
This project is assisting more than 80 communities.
==Demographics==Ethiopia's population has grown from 33.5 million in 1983 to 87.9 million in 2014.
The population was only about 9 million in the 19th century.
The 2007 Population and Housing Census results show that the population of Ethiopia grew at an average annual rate of 2.6% between 1994 and 2007, down from 2.8% during the period 1983–1994.
Currently, the population growth rate is among the top ten countries in the world.
The population is forecast to grow to over 210 million by 2060, which would be an increase from 2011 estimates by a factor of about 2.5.
According to the Ethiopian national census of 2007, the Oromo are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, at 34.4% of the nation's population.
The Amhara represent 27.0% of the country's inhabitants, while the Somali and Tigray represent 6.22% and 6.08% of the population, respectively.
Other prominent ethnic groups are as follows: Sidama 4.00%, Gurage 2.52%, Welayta 2.27%, Afar 1.73%, Hadiya 1.72%, Gamo 1.49% and others 12.6%.
The Arabic form of this term (Al-Habasha) is the etymological basis of "Abyssinia," the former name of Ethiopia in English and other European languages.
The largest ethnic groups among these include the Nuer and Anuak.
The majority of this population came from Somalia (approximately 64,300 persons), Eritrea (41,700) and Sudan (25,900).
The Ethiopian government required nearly all refugees to live in refugee camps.
==Health==According to the head of the World Bank's Global HIV/AIDS Program, Ethiopia has only 1 medical doctor per 100,000 people.
However, the World Health Organization's 2006 World Health Report gives a figure of 1,936 physicians (for 2003), which comes to about 2.6 per 100,000.
Globalization is said to affect the country, with many educated professionals leaving Ethiopia for better economic opportunities in the West.
Birth rates, infant mortality rates, and death rates are lower in cities than in rural areas owing to better access to education, medicines and hospitals.
Life expectancy is higher at 53, compared to 48 in rural areas.
Despite sanitation being a problem, use of improved water sources is also on the rise; 81% in cities compared to 11% in rural areas.
There are 119 hospitals (12 in Addis Ababa alone) and 412 health centers in Ethiopia.
Ethiopia has a relatively low average life expectancy of 58 years.
Infant mortality rates are relatively very high, as over 8% of infants die during or shortly after childbirth, (although this is a dramatic decrease from 16% in 1965) while birth-related complications such as obstetric fistula affect many of the nation's women.
The most affected are poor communities and women, due to lack of health education, empowerment, awareness and lack of social well-being.
The government of Ethiopia and many private organizations like World Health Organization (WHO), and the United Nations, are launching campaigns and are working aggressively to improve Ethiopia's health conditions and promote health awareness on AIDS and other communicable diseases (Dugassa, 2005).
Many believe that sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea result from touching a stone after a female dog urinates on it and there is a general belief that these diseases are caused by bad spirits and supernatural causes.
Others believe that eating the reproductive organs of a black goat will help expel the diseases from those same organ in their body (Kater, 2000).
Ethiopia has high infant and maternal mortality rate.
Only a minority of Ethiopians are born in hospitals; most of them are born in rural households.
Those who are expected to give birth at home have elderly women serve as midwives assist with the delivery (Kater, 2000) The increase in infant and maternal mortality rate is believed to be due to lack of women's involvement in household decision-making, immunization and social capital (Fantahun, Berhane, Wall, Byass, &amp; Hogberg, 2007).
The low availability of health care professionals with modern medical training, together with lack of funds for medical services, leads to the preponderancy of less reliable traditional healers that use home-based therapies to heal common ailments.
FGC is least prevalent in the regions of Tigray and Gambela, where 29% and 27% of girls and women, respectively, are affected.
==Education==Education in Ethiopia had been dominated by the Orthodox Church for many centuries until secular education was adopted in the early 1900s.The current system follows very similar school expansion schemes to the rural areas as the previous 1980s system with an addition of deeper regionalization giving rural education in their own languages starting at the elementary level and with more budget allocated to the education sector.
The sequence of general education in Ethiopia is six years of primary school, four years of lower secondary school and two years of higher secondary school.
In 2004 school enrollment was more than that of many other African countries.
Everyone is addressed by his/her given name.
===Calendar===Ethiopia has several local calendars.
It is based on the older Alexandrian or Coptic calendar, which in turn derives from the Egyptian calendar.
Like the Coptic calendar, the Ethiopian calendar has twelve months of exactly 30 days each plus five or six epagomenal days, which comprise a thirteenth month.
Like the Julian calendar, the sixth epagomenal day — which in essence is a leap day — is added every four years without exception on 29 August of the Julian calendar, six months before the Julian leap day.
Thus the first day of the Ethiopian year, 1 Mäskäräm, for years between 1901 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually 11 September (Gregorian), but falls on 12 September in years before the Gregorian leap year.
Oromo months (stars/lunar phases) are Bittottessa (Iangulum), Camsa (Pleiades), Bufa (Aldebarran), Waxabajjii (Belletrix), Obora Gudda (Central Orion-Saiph), Obora Dikka (Sirius), Birra (full moon), Cikawa (gibbous moon), Sadasaa (quarter moon), Abrasa (large crescent), Ammaji (medium crescent) and Gurrandala (small crescent).
===Time===Time in Ethiopia is counted differently from in many Western countries.
To convert between the Ethiopian clock and Western clocks, one must add (or subtract) 6 hours to the Western time.
For example, 2 AM local Addis Ababa time is called "8 at night" in Ethiopia, while 8 PM is called "2 in the evening".
Almost universally in Ethiopia, it is common to eat from the same dish in the center of the table with a group of people.
Chechebsa (ጨጨብሣ), marqa, chukko, michirra and dhanga are the most popular dishes from the Oromo.
Kitfo (ክትፎ), which originated from the Gurage is one of the widely accepted and favorite foods in Ethiopia.
===Music===The music of Ethiopia is extremely diverse, with each of the country's 80 ethnic groups being associated with unique sounds.
Ethiopian music uses a distinct modal system that is pentatonic, with characteristically long intervals between some notes.
As with many other aspects of Ethiopian culture and tradition, tastes in music and lyrics are strongly linked with those in neighboring Eritrea, Somalia, Djibouti and Sudan.
===Sport===The main sports in Ethiopia are athletics (particularly long distance running) and football (soccer).
As of 2012 going into 2013 the current national Ethiopian football team (Walyia Antelopes) has made itself history by qualifying for the 2012 African Cup of Nations (CAF) and more recently by reaching the last 10 African football teams in the last stage of qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
Ethiopia has Sub-Saharan Africa's longest basketball tradition as it established a national basketball team as early as 1949.

Belgium's two largest regions are the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders in the north and the French-speaking southern region of Wallonia.
Historically, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg were known as the Low Countries; it once covered a somewhat larger area than the current Benelux group of states.
The region was called Belgica in Latin, after the Roman province of Gallia Belgica, which covered more or less the same area.
==Demographics==Almost all of the Belgian population is urban—97% in 2004.
The population density of Belgium is 365 per square kilometre (952 per square mile) as of March 2013.
As of 2007, nearly 92% of the population had Belgian citizenship, and other European Union member citizens account for around 6%.
In 2007, there were 1.38 million foreign-born residents in Belgium, corresponding to 12.9% of the total population.
At the beginning of 2012, people of foreign background and their descendants were estimated to have formed around 25% of the total population i.e.
Of these new Belgians, 1,200,000 are of European ancestry and 1,350,000 are from non-Western countries (most of them from Morocco, Turkey, and the DR Congo).
Since the modification of the Belgian nationality law in 1984 more than 1.3 million migrants have acquired Belgian citizenship.
The largest group of immigrants and their descendants in Belgium are Moroccans, with more than 450,000 people.
The Turks are the third largest group, and the second largest Muslim ethnic group, numbering 220,000.
89.2% of inhabitants of Turkish origin have been naturalized, as have 88.4% of people of Moroccan background, 75.4% of Italians, 56.2% of the French and 47.8% of Dutch people.
===Languages===Belgium has three official languages, which are (in order of size of the native speaking population of Belgium) Dutch, French and German.
A number of non-official minority languages are spoken as well.
As no census exists, there are no official statistical data regarding the distribution or usage of Belgium's three official languages or their dialects.
An estimated 60% of the Belgian population speaks Dutch (often referred to as Flemish), and 40% of the population speaks French.
Roughly 23,000 more German speakers live in municipalities near the official Community.
According to 2012 estimates, the average life expectancy is 79.65 years.
Death in Belgium is mainly due to heart and vascular disorders, neoplasms, disorders of the respiratory system and unnatural causes of death (accidents, suicide).
Non-natural causes of death and cancer are the most common causes of death for females up to age 24 and males up to age 44.
==Culture==Despite its political and linguistic divisions, the region corresponding to today's Belgium has seen the flourishing of major artistic movements that have had tremendous influence on European art and culture.
Nowadays, to a certain extent, cultural life is concentrated within each language Community, and a variety of barriers have made a shared cultural sphere less pronounced.
Since the 1970s, there are no bilingual universities or colleges in the country except the Royal Military Academy and the Antwerp Maritime Academy, no common media and no single large cultural or scientific organisation in which both main communities are represented.
The Mosan art, the Early Netherlandish, the Flemish Renaissance and Baroque painting and major examples of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque architecture are milestones in the history of art.
Though the Baroque style of Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck flourished in the early 17th century in the Southern Netherlands, it gradually declined thereafter.
The avant-garde CoBrA movement appeared in the 1950s, while the sculptor Panamarenko remains a remarkable figure in contemporary art.
The vocal music of the Franco-Flemish School developed in the southern part of the Low Countries and was an important contribution to Renaissance culture.
In the 19th and 20th centuries, there was an emergence of major violinists, such as Henri Vieuxtemps, Eugène Ysaÿe and Arthur Grumiaux, while Adolphe Sax invented the saxophone in 1846.
Contemporary music in Belgium is also of repute.
In rock/pop music, Telex, Front 242, K's Choice, Hooverphonic, Zap Mama, Soulwax and dEUS are well known.
The poet and playwright Maurice Maeterlinck won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1911.

In 2000, Belarus and Russia signed a treaty for greater cooperation, with some hints of forming a Union State.
More than 80% of the population is ethnic Belarusian, with sizable minorities of Russians, Poles and Ukrainians.

Latvia (; , officially the Republic of Latvia (), is a country in the Baltic region of Northern Europe, one of the three Baltic states.
The Republic of Latvia was founded on 18 November 1918.
In the beginning of the 13th century, large parts of today's Latvia were ruled by Germans.
Together with Southern Estonia, these conquered areas formed the crusader state that became known as Terra Mariana or Livonia.
Latgalia, the easternmost region of Latvia, became a part of the Polish district of Inflanty.
The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia became an autonomous Russian province (the Courland Governorate) in 1795, bringing all of what is now Latvia into the Russian Empire.
The Young Latvian () movement laid the groundwork for nationalism from the middle of the century, many of its leaders looking to the Slavophiles for support against the prevailing German-dominated social order.
Popular discontent exploded in the 1905 Russian Revolution, which took a nationalist character in the Baltic provinces.
The War of Independence that followed was part of a general chaotic period of civil and new border wars in Eastern Europe.
Eastern Latvia was cleared of Red Army forces by Latvian and Polish troops in early 1920 (from the Polish perspective the Battle of Daugavpils was a part of the Polish-Soviet War).
With most of Latvia's industrial base evacuated to the interior of Russia in 1915, radical land reform was the central political question for the young state.
In 1897, 61.2% of the rural population had been landless; by 1936, that percentage had been reduced to 18%.
By 1923, the extent of cultivated land surpassed the pre-war level.
Innovation and rising productivity led to rapid growth of the economy, but it soon suffered from the effects of the Great Depression.
The pact contained a secret protocol, revealed only after Germany's defeat in 1945, according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet "spheres of influence".

The Soviet Union incorporated Latvia on 5 August 1940, as The "Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic.
Under German occupation, Latvia was administered as part of "Reichskommissariat Ostland".
In 1944, part of the Latvian territory once more came under Soviet control.
The Soviets immediately began to reinstate the Soviet system.
After the German surrender, it became clear that Soviet forces were there to stay, and Latvian national partisans, soon joined by German collaborators, began to fight against the new occupier.
Most sources count 200,000 to 250,000 refugees leaving Latvia, with perhaps as many as 80,000 to 100,000 of them recaptured by the Soviets or, during few months immediately after the end of war, returned by the West.
In the post-war period, Latvia was made to adopt Soviet farming methods.
All of the minority schools (Jewish, Polish, Belorussian, Estonian, Lithuanian) were closed down leaving only two media of instructions in the schools: Latvian and Russian.
To maintain and expand industrial production, skilled workers were migrating from all over the Soviet Union, decreasing the proportion of ethnic Latvians in the republic.
In the summer of 1988, a national movement, coalescing in the Popular Front of Latvia, was opposed by the Interfront.
Pro-independence Popular Front of Latvia candidates gained a two-thirds majority in the Supreme Council in the March 1990 democratic elections.
However, the central power in Moscow continued to regard Latvia as a Soviet republic in 1990 and 1991.
In January 1991, Soviet political and military forces tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the Republic of Latvia authorities by occupying the central publishing house in Riga and establishing a Committee of National Salvation to usurp governmental functions.
During the transitional period, Moscow maintained many central Soviet state authorities in Latvia.
In spite of this, 73% of all Latvian residents confirmed their strong support for independence on 3 March 1991, in a nonbinding advisory referendum.
Still, today there are 290,660 non-citizens in Latvia, which represent 14.1% of population.
They have no citizenship of any country, and cannot vote in Latvia.

There are 14 heritage sites inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage and 54 Historical Monuments and many objects of cultural heritage.
With origins in the culture of the Proto-Slavs, over time Polish culture has been profoundly influenced by its interweaving ties with the Germanic, Latinate and Byzantine worlds as well as in continual dialog with the many other ethnic groups and minorities living in Poland.
The people of Poland have traditionally been seen as hospitable to artists from abroad and eager to follow cultural and artistic trends popular in other countries.
These factors have contributed to the versatile nature of Polish art, with all its complex nuances.

Poland has maintained a high level of gender equality, an established disability rights movement and promotes peaceful equality.
Poland has, throughout most of its long history, experienced only very limited immigration from abroad; this trend can be largely attributed to Poland's rejection of slavery and to a lack of overseas colonies as well as occupation of its territories during much of the 19th and early 20th centuries.

b Sources vary with regards to what was the largest resistance movement during World War II.
The confusion often stems from the fact that as war progressed, some resistance movements grew larger – and other diminished.
Certainly, Polish resistance was the largest resistance till German invasion of Yugoslavia and invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.
After that point, the numbers of Soviet partisans and Yugoslav partisans begun growing rapidly.
The numbers of Soviet partisans quickly caught up and were very similar to that of the Polish resistance.
The numbers of Tito's Yugoslav partisans were roughly similar to those of the Polish and Soviet partisans in the first years of the war (1941–1942), but grew rapidly in the latter years, outnumbering the Polish and Soviet partisans by 2:1 or more (estimates give Yugoslavian forces about 800,000 in 1945, to Polish and Soviet forces of 400,000 in 1944).

==Etymology==The etymology of the word Denmark, and especially the relationship between Danes and Denmark and the unifying of Denmark as a single kingdom, is a subject which attracts debate.
This is centred primarily on the prefix "Dan" and whether it refers to the Dani or a historical person Dan and the exact meaning of the -"mark" ending.
The issue is further complicated by a number of references to various Dani people in Scandinavia or other places in Europe in Greek and Roman accounts (like Ptolemy, Jordanes, and Gregory of Tours), as well as mediaeval literature (like Adam of Bremen, Beowulf, Widsith, and Poetic Edda).
The Roman provinces maintained trade routes and relations with native tribes in Denmark, and Roman coins have been found in Denmark.
Evidence of strong Celtic cultural influence dates from this period in Denmark and much of North-West Europe and is among other things reflected in the finding of the Gundestrup cauldron.
A new runic alphabet was first used around the same time and Ribe, the oldest town of Denmark, was founded about AD 700.
Thus, much of the next 125 years of Scandinavian history revolves around this union, with Sweden breaking off and being re-conquered repeatedly.
The issue was for practical purposes resolved on 17 June 1523, as Swedish King Gustav Vasa conquered the city of Stockholm.

Switzerland has gone from a largely rural country to an urban one in just 70 years.
Since 1935 urban development has claimed as much of the Swiss landscape as it did during the previous 2,000 years.
This urban sprawl does not only affect the plateau but also the Jura and the Alpine foothills and there are growing concerns about land use.
However from the beginning of the 21st century, the population growth in urban areas is higher than in the countryside.
Switzerland has a dense network of cities, where large, medium and small cities are complementary.
The plateau is very densely populated with about 450 people per km2 and the landscape continually shows signs of man's presence.
In international comparison the importance of these urban areas is stronger than their number of inhabitants suggests.

This period saw the Italian Wars, the Revolt of the Comuneros, the Dutch Revolt, the Morisco Revolt, clashes with the Ottomans, the Anglo-Spanish War and wars with France.
The result was a country forced into ever expanding military efforts across Europe and in the Mediterranean.
Spain managed to hold on to most of the scattered Habsburg empire, and help the imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire reverse a large part of the advances made by Protestant forces, but it was finally forced to recognise the separation of Portugal (with whom it had been united in a personal union of the crowns from 1580 to 1640) and the Netherlands, and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to France in the latter stages of the immensely destructive, Europe-wide Thirty Years' War.

A period of authoritarian rule under General Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923–1931) ended with the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic.
After World War II Spain was politically and economically isolated, and was kept out of the United Nations.

With Franco's death in November 1975, Juan Carlos succeeded to the position of King of Spain and head of state in accordance with the law.
With the approval of the new Spanish Constitution of 1978 and the restoration of democracy, the State devolved much authority to the regions and created an internal organisation based on autonomous communities.

Nine out of the 18 members of the government are women.
The Spanish administration has also promoted gender-based positive discrimination by approving gender equality legislation in 2007 aimed at providing equality between genders in Spanish political and economic life (Gender Equality Act).
However, in the legislative branch, as of July 2010 only 128 of the 350 members of the Congress are women (36.3%).
In the Senate, the ratio is even lower, since there are only 79 women out of 263 (30.0%).
The Gender Empowerment Measure of Spain in the United Nations Human Development Report is 0.794, 12th in the world.
=== Foreign relations ===After the return of democracy following the death of Franco in 1975, Spain's foreign policy priorities were to break out of the diplomatic isolation of the Franco years and expand diplomatic relations, enter the European Community, and define security relations with the West.

Spain's population density, at 91/km² (235/sq mi), is lower than that of most Western European countries and its distribution across the country is very unequal.
Native Spaniards make up 88% of the total population of Spain.
After the birth rate plunged in the 1980s and Spain's population growth rate dropped, the population again trended upward, based initially on the return of many Spaniards who had emigrated to other European countries during the 1970s, and more recently, fuelled by large numbers of immigrants who make up 12% of the population.
The immigrants originate mainly in Latin America (39%), North Africa (16%), Eastern Europe (15%), and Sub-Saharan Africa (4%).
In 2008, Spain granted citizenship to 84,170 persons, mostly to people from Ecuador, Colombia and Morocco.

During the same period perhaps 300,000 went to Latin America.
For some people, Spain's identity consists more of an overlap of different regional identities than of a sole Spanish identity.
Indeed, some of the regional identities may even conflict with the Spanish one.
Since 2000, Spain has experienced high population growth as a result of immigration flows, despite a birth rate that is only half the replacement level.
The number of immigrants in Spain had grown up from 500,000 people in 1996 to 5.2 million in 2008 out of a total population of 46 million.

Most Spaniards do not participate regularly in religious services.
This same study shows that of the Spaniards who identify themselves as religious, 59% hardly ever or never go to church, 15% go to church some times a year, 8% some time per month and 14% every Sunday or multiple times per week.
Altogether, about 22% of the entire Spanish population attends religious services at least once per month.
Though Spanish society has become considerably more secular in recent decades, the influx of Latin American immigrants, who tend to be strong Catholic practitioners, has helped the Catholic Church to recover.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has approximately 46,000 adherents in 133 congregations in all regions of the country and has a temple in the Moratalaz District of Madrid.

Jammeh won the 2006 election handily after the opposition coalition, the National Alliance for Democracy and Development, splintered earlier in the year.
The voting was generally regarded as free and fair, though events from the run-up raised criticism from some.
A journalist from the state television station assigned to the chief opposition candidate, Ousainou Darboe, was arrested.
Additionally, Jammeh said, "I will develop the areas that vote for me, but if you don't vote for me, don't expect anything".

Historically, the Liberian economy has depended heavily on foreign aid, foreign direct investment and exports of natural resources such as iron ore, rubber and timber.
Following a peak in growth in 1979, the Liberian economy began a steady decline due to economic mismanagement following the 1980 coup.
This decline was accelerated by the outbreak of civil war in 1989; GDP was reduced by an estimated 90% between 1989 and 1995, one of the fastest declines in history.
Upon the end of the war in 2003, GDP growth began to accelerate, reaching 9.4% in 2007.
The global financial crisis slowed GDP growth to 4.6% in 2009, though a strengthening agricultural sector led by rubber and timber exports increased growth to 5.1% in 2010 and an expected 7.3% in 2011, making the economy one of the 20 fastest growing in the world.
Current impediments to growth include a small domestic market, lack of adequate infrastructure, high transportation costs, poor trade links with neighboring countries and the high dollarization of the economy.

=== Foreign relations ===Upon gaining independence in 1960, Nigeria made African unity the centrepiece of its foreign policy and played a leading role in the fight against the apartheid government in South Africa.
One notable exception to the African focus was Nigeria's close relationship developed with Israel throughout the 1960s.
Nigeria's foreign policy was tested in the 1970s after the country emerged united from its own civil war.
It supported movements against white minority governments in the Southern Africa sub-region.
Nigeria backed the African National Congress (ANC) by taking a committed tough line with regard to the South African government and their military actions in southern Africa.
Nigeria was also a founding member of the Organisation for African Unity (now the African Union), and has tremendous influence in West Africa and Africa on the whole.
With this African-centred stance, Nigeria readily sent troops to the Congo at the behest of the United Nations shortly after independence (and has maintained membership since that time).

Nyerere became Minister of British-administered Tanganyika in 1960 and continued as prime minister when Tanganyika became independent in 1961.
After the declaration, banks and many large industries were nationalised.
Located on the equator, Gabon is bordered by Equatorial Guinea to the northwest, Cameroon to the north, the Republic of the Congo on the east and south, and the Gulf of Guinea to the west.
In 1910 Gabon became one of the four territories of French Equatorial Africa, a federation that survived until 1959.
These territories became independent on August 17, 1960.
The coastal plains form a large section of the World Wildlife Fund's Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests ecoregion and contain patches of Central African mangroves especially on the Muni River estuary on the border with Equatorial Guinea.
Gabon has three karst areas where there are hundreds of caves located in the dolomite and limestone rocks.
Natural resources include: petroleum, magnesium, iron, gold, uranium, and forests.
In the Zambezi basin, there are a number of major rivers flowing wholly or partially through Zambia: the Kabompo, Lungwebungu, Kafue, Luangwa, and the Zambezi itself, which flows through the country in the west and then forms its southern border with Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe.
Its source is in Zambia but it diverts into Angola, and a number of its tributaries rise in Angola's central highlands.
The Zambezi valley, running along the southern border, is both deep and wide.
The Luangwa Valley splits the plateau in a curve north east to south west, extended west into the heart of the plateau by the deep valley of the Lunsemfwa River.
Their culminating peak Mumpu is at the western end and at is the highest point in Zambia away from the eastern border region.
Mozambique ( or ), officially the Republic of Mozambique ( or "", ), is a country in Southeast Africa bordered by the Indian Ocean to the east, Tanzania to the north, Malawi and Zambia to the northwest, Zimbabwe to the west, and Swaziland and South Africa to the southwest.
The only official language of Mozambique is Portuguese, which is spoken mostly as a second language by about half of the population.
The largest religion in Mozambique is Christianity, with significant minorities following Islam and African traditional religions.
There are around 350 species of mammals that can be found in Zimbabwe.
There are also many snakes and lizards, over 500 bird species, and 131 fish species.
An association of doctors in Zimbabwe has made calls for President Mugabe to make moves to assist the ailing health service.
Some 85% of Zimbabweans are Christian; 62% of the population attends religious services regularly.
English is spoken primarily in the cities, but less so in rural areas.
== Health ==At independence, the policies of racial inequality were reflected in the disease patterns of the black majority.
The first five years after independence saw rapid gains in areas such as immunisation coverage, access to health care, and contraceptive prevalence rate.
The country suffered occasional outbreaks of acute diseases (such as plague in 1994).
The gains on the national health were eroded by structural adjustment in the 1990s, the impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and the economic crisis since the year 2000.
By the end of November 2008, three of Zimbabwe's four major hospitals had shut down, along with the Zimbabwe Medical School, and the fourth major hospital had two wards and no operating theatres working.
The ongoing political and economic crisis also contributed to the emigration of the doctors and people with medical knowledge.
On 4 December 2008 the Zimbabwe government declared the outbreak to be a national emergency and asked for international aid.
By 9 March 2009 The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 4,011 people had succumbed to the waterborne disease since the outbreak began in August 2008, and the total number of cases recorded had reached 89,018.
In Harare, the city council offered free graves to cholera victims.
In June 2011, the United Nations Population Fund released a report on The State of the World's Midwifery.
It contained new data on the midwifery workforce and policies relating to newborn and maternal mortality for 58 countries.
The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Zimbabwe is 790.
The education department has stated that 20,000 teachers have left Zimbabwe since 2007 and that half of Zimbabwe's children have not progressed beyond primary school.
School education was made free in 1980, but since 1988, the government has steadily increased the charges attached to school enrolment until they now greatly exceed the real value of fees in 1980.
The academic year in Zimbabwe runs from January to December, with three terms, broken up by one month holidays, with a total of 40 weeks of school per year.
There are seven public universities as well as four church-related universities in Zimbabwe that are fully internationally accredited.
The University of Zimbabwe, the first and largest, was built in 1952 and is located in the Harare suburb of Mount Pleasant.
Education in Zimbabwe became under threat since the economic changes in 2000 with teachers going on strike because of low pay, students unable to concentrate because of hunger and the price of uniforms soaring making this standard a luxury.

These alliances were reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war: Italy, Japan and the United States joined the Allies, and the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria the Central Powers.
Ultimately, more than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history.
Meanwhile, on the Eastern Front, the Russian army was successful against the Austro-Hungarians, but was stopped in its invasion of East Prussia by the Germans.
These had started in 1815, with the Holy Alliance between Prussia, Russia, and Austria.
With the launch of in 1906, the British Empire expanded on its significant advantage over its German rival.
The arms race between Britain and Germany eventually extended to the rest of Europe, with all the major powers devoting their industrial base to producing the equipment and weapons necessary for a pan-European conflict.
Between 1908 and 1913, the military spending of the European powers increased by 50%.
Germany attacked Luxembourg on 2 August and on 3 August declared war on France.
On 4 August, after Belgium refused to permit German troops to cross its borders into France, Germany declared war on Belgium as well.
The plan called for the right flank of the German advance to bypass the French armies (which were concentrated on the Franco-German border, leaving the Belgian border without significant French forces) and move south to Paris.
Initially the Germans were successful, particularly in the Battle of the Frontiers (14–24 August).
By 12 September, the French, with assistance from the British forces, halted the German advance east of Paris at the First Battle of the Marne (5–12 September), and pushed the German forces back some .
The last days of this battle signified the end of mobile warfare in the west.
In response, Germany rapidly moved the 8th Field Army, from its previous role as reserve for the invasion of France, to East Prussia by rail across the German Empire.
While the Russian invasion failed, it caused the diversion of German troops to the east, allowing the tactical Allied victory at the First Battle of the Marne.
====Asia and the Pacific====New Zealand occupied German Samoa (later Western Samoa) on 30 August 1914.
The German colonial forces in German East Africa, led by Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, fought a guerrilla warfare campaign during World War I and only surrendered two weeks after the armistice took effect in Europe.
The Indian Army in fact outnumbered the British Army at the beginning of the war; about 1.3 million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while the central government and the princely states sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition.
In all, 140,000 men served on the Western Front and nearly 700,000 in the Middle East.
Casualties of Indian soldiers totalled 47,746 killed and 65,126 wounded during World War I.
On 22 April 1915, at the Second Battle of Ypres, the Germans (violating the Hague Convention) used chlorine gas for the first time on the Western Front.
German U-boats attempted to cut the supply lines between North America and Britain.
Finally, in early 1917, Germany adopted a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, realising that the Americans would eventually enter the war.
A Serbian counterattack in the Battle of Kolubara, however, succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of 1914.
Serbia was conquered in a little more than a month, as the Central Powers, now including Bulgaria, sent in 600,000 troops.
The Serbs suffered defeat in the Battle of Kosovo.
In Mesopotamia, by contrast, after the disastrous Siege of Kut (1915–16), British Imperial forces reorganised and captured Baghdad in March 1917.
Russian armies generally had the best of it in the Caucasus.
In December 1914 the Ottoman Empire, with German support, invaded Persia (modern Iran) in an effort to cut off British and Russian access to petroleum reservoirs around Baku near the Caspian Sea.
General Yudenich, the Russian commander from 1915 to 1916, drove the Turks out of most of the southern Caucasus with a string of victories.
Rome had a secret 1902 pact with France, effectively nullifying its alliance.
The Austro-Hungarian government began negotiations to secure Italian neutrality, offering the French colony of Tunisia in return.
On 1 November, the Italian Navy destroyed much of the Austro-Hungarian fleet stationed in Pula, preventing it from being handed over to the new State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs.
As a result of the Battle of Bucharest, the Central Powers occupied Bucharest on 6 December 1916.
The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the Alexandru Marghiloman government, and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918.
Total Romanian deaths from 1914 to 1918, military and civilian, within contemporary borders, were estimated at 748,000.
On 5 August, they captured Warsaw and forced the Russians to withdraw from Poland.
Meanwhile, unrest grew in Russia, as the Tsar remained at the front.
At first, the Bolsheviks refused the German terms, but when German troops began marching across the Ukraine unopposed, the new government acceded to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 3 March 1918.
The Legion in Russia was established in 1917, in December 1917 in France (including volunteers from America) and in April 1918 in Italy.
In Russia, they were heavily involved in the Russian Civil War fighting the Bolsheviks, at times controlling most of the Trans-Siberian railway and conquering all major cities in Siberia.
The British naval blockade began to have a serious impact on Germany.
Britain was safe from starvation, while German industrial output fell and the United States troops joined the war in large numbers far earlier than Germany had anticipated.
Previously, British and French armies had operated under separate commands.
====Ottoman Empire conflict, 1917–1918====In March and April 1917, at the First and Second Battles of Gaza, German and Ottoman forces stopped the advance of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, which had begun in August 1916 at Romani.
During several months of reorganisation and training during the summer, a number of attacks were carried out on sections of the Ottoman front line.
It was not until the middle of September that the integrated force was ready for large-scale operations.
Wilson called on antiwar elements to end all wars, by winning this one and eliminating militarism from the globe.
He argued that the war was so important that the US had to have a voice in the peace conference.
The United States had a small army, but, after the passage of the Selective Service Act, it drafted 2.8 million men, and, by summer 1918, was sending 10,000 fresh soldiers to France every day.
The operation commenced on 21 March 1918, with an attack on British forces near Amiens.
This German success relied greatly on the element of surprise.
By 20 July, the Germans had retreated across the Marne to their starting lines, having achieved little, and the German Army never regained the initiative.
====New states under war zone====In the late spring of 1918, three new states were formed in the South Caucasus: the First Republic of Armenia, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia, which declared their independence from the Russian Empire.
Solidarity was briefly maintained when the Transcaucasian Federative Republic was created in the spring of 1918, but this collapsed in May, when the Georgians asked and received protection from Germany and the Azerbaijanis concluded a treaty with the Ottoman Empire that was more akin to a military alliance.
After an advance as far as , German resistance stiffened, and the battle was concluded on 12 August.
In nearly four weeks of fighting beginning 8 August, over 100,000 German prisoners were taken, 75,000 by the BEF and the rest by the French.
On 8 October the line was pierced again by British and Dominion troops at the Battle of Cambrai.
Meanwhile, news of Germany's impending military defeat spread throughout the German armed forces.
The collapse of the Balkans meant that Germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food.
Its reserves had been used up, even as US troops kept arriving at the rate of 10,000 per day.
Negotiations with President Wilson began immediately, in the hope that he would offer better terms than the British and French.
During the last week of October, declarations of independence were made in Budapest, Prague, and Zagreb.
On 3 November, Austria-Hungary sent a flag of truce to ask for an armistice.
On 11 November, at 5:00 am, an armistice with Germany was signed in a railroad carriage at Compiègne.
Among the Allies, the UK spent $21 billion and the US $17 billion; among the Central Powers Germany spent $20 billion.
===Peace treaties and national boundaries===After the war, the Paris Peace Conference imposed a series of peace treaties on the Central Powers officially ending the war.
The Russian Empire, which had withdrawn from the war in 1917 after the October Revolution, lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland were carved from it.
When Britain declared war in 1914, the dominions were automatically at war; at the conclusion, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa were individual signatories of the Treaty of Versailles.
Germany lost 15.1% of its active male population, Austria-Hungary lost 17.1%, and France lost 10.5%.
By 1922, there were between 4.5 million and 7 million homeless children in Russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from World War I, the Russian Civil War, and the subsequent famine of 1920–1922.
Thousands more emigrated to France, England, and the United States.
Diseases flourished in the chaotic wartime conditions.
In 1914 alone, louse-borne epidemic typhus killed 200,000 in Serbia.
From 1918 to 1922, Russia had about 25 million infections and 3 million deaths from epidemic typhus.
By 1914, their military utility was obvious.
They were initially used for reconnaissance and ground attack.
The shooting was reported to the media by American citizens who were on board the "Nicosia", a British freighter loaded with war supplies, which was stopped by U-27 just minutes before the incident.
It is estimated that the use of chemical weapons employed by both sides throughout the war had inflicted 1.3 million casualties.
Many commanders on both sides knew that such weapons would cause major harm to civilians as wind would blow poison gases into nearby civilian towns but nonetheless continued to use them throughout the war.
Germany held 2.5 million prisoners; Russia held 2.2–2.9 million; while Britain and France held about 720,000.
Once prisoners reached a camp, conditions were, in general, satisfactory (and much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the International Red Cross and inspections by neutral nations.
However, conditions were terrible in Russia: starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike; about 15–20% of the prisoners in Russia died (in some researches it is stated that 2.5% of prisoners in Russia died), and in Central Powers imprisonment—8% of Russians.
In Germany, food was scarce, but only 5% died.
German prisoners were still being held in Russia as late as 1924.
The Yugoslav Committee was formed in Paris on 30 April 1915 but shortly moved its office to London; Trumbić led the Committee.
In the Middle East, Arab nationalism soared in Ottoman territories in response to the rise of Turkish nationalism during the war, with Arab nationalist leaders advocating the creation of a pan-Arab state.
A number of socialist parties initially supported the war when it began in August 1914.
The war began amid the Home Rule crisis in Ireland that had resurfaced in 1912 and, by July 1914, there was a serious possibility of an outbreak of civil war in Ireland.
In Britain, 16,000 people asked for conscientious objector status.
The Central Asian Revolt started in the summer of 1916, when the Russian Empire government ended its exemption of Muslims from military service.
In Milan, in May 1917, Bolshevik revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war, and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation.
The Italian army was forced to enter Milan with tanks and machine guns to face Bolsheviks and anarchists, who fought violently until 23 May when the army gained control of the city.
It opened a political gap between French Canadians, who believed their true loyalty should be to Canada and not to the British Empire, and members of the Anglophone majority, who saw the war as a duty to both Britain and Canada.
Around 625,000 Canadians served in World War I, of which 60,000 were killed and 173,000 wounded.
Most deaths were to young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers.
The experiences of the war led to a collective trauma shared by many from all participating countries.
To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily on Wall Street.
President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916, but allowed a great increase in US government lending to the Allies.
This circular system collapsed in 1931 and the loans were never repaid.
" Thus, following the Second World War, at the London Conference in 1953, Germany agreed to resume payment on the money borrowed.
On 3 October 2010, Germany made the final payment on these bonds.
1922) comprises the 11th edition plus three new volumes 30-31-32 that cover events since 1911 with thorough coverage of the war as well as every country and colony.

The first phase of the Cold War began in the first two years after the end of the Second World War in 1945.
The USSR consolidated its control over the states of the Eastern Bloc while the United States began a strategy of global containment to challenge Soviet power, extending military and financial aid to the countries of Western Europe (for example, supporting the anti-Communist side in the Greek Civil War) and creating the NATO alliance.
The Berlin Blockade (1948–49) was the first major crisis of the Cold War.
With victory of the Communist side in the Chinese Civil War and the outbreak of the Korean War (1950–53), the conflict expanded.
The USSR and USA competed for influence in Latin America and decolonizing states of Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia.
Meanwhile the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was stopped by the Soviets.
1985) and ended Soviet involvement in Afghanistan.
The result in 1989 was a wave of revolutions that peacefully (with the exception of the Romanian Revolution) overthrew all of the Communist regimes of Central and Eastern Europe.
Soviet agents took control of the media, especially radio; they quickly harassed and then banned all independent civic institutions, from youth groups to schools, churches and rival political parties.
Stalin also sought continued peace with Britain and the United States, hoping to focus on internal reconstruction and economic growth.
In the American view, Stalin seemed a potential ally in accomplishing their goals, whereas in the British approach Stalin appeared as the greatest threat to the fulfillment of their agenda.
With the Soviets already occupying most of Central and Eastern Europe, Stalin was at an advantage and the two western leaders vied for his favors.
The differences between Roosevelt and Churchill led to several separate deals with the Soviets.
In October 1944, Churchill traveled to Moscow and agreed to divide the Balkans into respective spheres of influence, and at Yalta Roosevelt signed a separate deal with Stalin in regard of Asia and refused to support Churchill on the issues of Poland and the Reparations.
Following the Allies' May 1945 victory, the Soviets effectively occupied Central and Eastern Europe, while strong US and Western allied forces remained in Western Europe.
The Soviet-style regimes that arose in the Bloc not only reproduced Soviet command economies, but also adopted the brutal methods employed by Joseph Stalin and Soviet secret police to suppress real and potential opposition.
In February 1947, the British government announced that it could no longer afford to finance the Greek monarchical military regime in its civil war against communist-led insurgents ("see Greek Civil War").
The American government's response to this announcement was the adoption of containment, the goal of which was to stop the spread of communism.
In June 1947, in accordance with the Truman Doctrine, the United States enacted the Marshall Plan, a pledge of economic assistance for all European countries willing to participate, including the Soviet Union.
The plan's aim was to rebuild the democratic and economic systems of Europe and to counter perceived threats to Europe's balance of power, such as communist parties seizing control through revolutions or elections.
The plan also stated that European prosperity was contingent upon German economic recovery.
One month later, Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947, creating a unified Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the National Security Council (NSC).
These would become the main bureaucracies for US policy in the Cold War.
Stalin believed that economic integration with the West would allow Eastern Bloc countries to escape Soviet control, and that the US was trying to buy a pro-US re-alignment of Europe.
Stalin therefore prevented Eastern Bloc nations from receiving Marshall Plan aid.
The Soviet Union's alternative to the Marshall plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with central and eastern Europe, became known as the Molotov Plan (later institutionalized in January 1949 as the Comecon).
Stalin was also fearful of a reconstituted Germany; his vision of a post-war Germany did not include the ability to rearm or pose any kind of threat to the Soviet Union.
The twin policies of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan led to billions in economic and military aid for Western Europe, Greece, and Turkey.
With US assistance, the Greek military won its civil war.
At the same time there was increased intelligence and espionage activity, Eastern Bloc defections and diplomatic expulsions.
As part of the economic rebuilding of Germany, in early 1948, representatives of a number of Western European governments and the United States announced an agreement for a merger of western German areas into a federal governmental system.
Shortly thereafter, Stalin instituted the Berlin Blockade (24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949), one of the first major crises of the Cold War, preventing food, materials and supplies from arriving in West Berlin.
The United States, Britain, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and several other countries began the massive "Berlin airlift", supplying West Berlin with food and other provisions.
The Soviets mounted a public relations campaign against the policy change.
In May 1949, Stalin backed down and lifted the blockade.
Following Soviet refusals to participate in a German rebuilding effort set forth by western European countries in 1948, the US, Britain and France spearheaded the establishment of West Germany from the three Western zones of occupation in April 1949.
The Soviet Union proclaimed its zone of occupation in Germany the German Democratic Republic that October.
Radio Free Europe attempted to achieve these goals by serving as a surrogate home radio station, an alternative to the controlled and party-dominated domestic press.
Radio Free Europe was a product of some of the most prominent architects of America's early Cold War strategy, especially those who believed that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means, such as George F. Kennan.
In the early 1950s, the US worked for the rearmament of West Germany and, in 1955, secured its full membership of NATO.
In May 1953, Beria, by then in a government post, had made an unsuccessful proposal to allow the reunification of a neutral Germany to prevent West Germany's incorporation into NATO.
According to Norwegian historian Odd Arne Westad, the Communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China.
Moreover, his party was weakened in the war against Japanese.
Meanwhile the Communists told different groups, such as peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and cloaked themselves in the cover of Chinese nationalism.
In NSC-68, a secret 1950 document, the National Security Council proposed to reinforce pro-Western alliance systems and quadruple spending on defense.
In the early 1950s (a period sometimes known as the "Pactomania"), the US formalized a series of alliances with Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and the Philippines (notably ANZUS in 1951 and SEATO in 1954), thereby guaranteeing the United States a number of long-term military bases.
To Stalin's surprise, the UN Security Council backed the defense of South Korea, though the Soviets were then boycotting meetings in protest that Taiwan and not Communist China held a permanent seat on the Council.
Even though the Chinese and North Koreans were exhausted by the war and were prepared to end it by late 1952, Stalin insisted that they continue fighting, and the Armistice was approved only in July 1953, after Stalin's death.
After Rhee was overthrown in 1960, South Korea fell within a year under a period of military rule that lasted until the re-establishment of a multi-party system in the late 1980s.
As part of a campaign of de-Stalinization, he declared that the only way to reform and move away from Stalin's policies would be to acknowledge errors made in the past.
On 18 November 1956, while addressing Western ambassadors at a reception at the Polish embassy in Moscow, Khrushchev used his famous "Whether you like it or not, history is on our side.
He later claimed that he had not been talking about nuclear war, but rather about the historically determined victory of communism over capitalism.
Possessing nuclear superiority, for example, allowed Eisenhower to face down Soviet threats to intervene in the Middle East during the 1956 Suez Crisis.
The Soviets, who had already created a network of mutual assistance treaties in the Eastern Bloc by 1949, established a formal alliance therein, the Warsaw Pact, in 1955.
The Soviet army invaded.
The field of AI research was founded at a conference on the campus of Dartmouth College in the summer of 1956.
In 1974, in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off all undirected exploratory research in AI.
However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer lasting AI winter began.
The success was due to several factors: the increasing computational power of computers (see Moore's law), a greater emphasis on solving specific subproblems, the creation of new ties between AI and other fields working on similar problems, and a new commitment by researchers to solid mathematical methods and rigorous scientific standards.
These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers would like an intelligent system to display.
" For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist sized, sings, and flies.
Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires.
AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.
Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of commonsense knowledge (e.g., Cyc) require enormous amounts of laborious ontological engineering—they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.
A major goal is to have the computer understand enough concepts to be able to learn by reading from sources like the internet, and thus be able to add to its own ontology.
Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge.
They need a way to visualize the future (they must have a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it) and be able to make choices that maximize the utility (or "value") of the available choices.
Researchers disagree about many issues.
Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at Princeton University and the Ratio Club in England.
==== Symbolic ====When access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation.
; Logic-based: Unlike Newell and Simon, John McCarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving, regardless of whether people used the same algorithms.
His laboratory at Stanford (SAIL) focused on using formal logic to solve a wide variety of problems, including knowledge representation, planning and learning.
Logic was also the focus of the work at the University of Edinburgh and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language Prolog and the science of logic programming.
; Knowledge-based: When computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build knowledge into AI applications.
The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications.
; Bottom-up, embodied, situated, behavior-based or nouvelle AI: Researchers from the related field of robotics, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive.
These tools are truly scientific, in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable, and they have been responsible for many of AI's recent successes.
The shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like mathematics, economics or operations research).
The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems.
The paradigm gives researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that are both verifiable and useful, without agreeing on one single approach.
The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields—such as decision theory and economics—that also use concepts of abstract agents.
The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.
A system with both symbolic and sub-symbolic components is a hybrid intelligent system, and the study of such systems is artificial intelligence systems integration.
For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule.
Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space.
Simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers.
The result is a search that is too slow or never completes.
==== Logic ====Logic is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well.
First-order logic also allows the use of quantifiers and predicates, and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other.
Fuzzy logic, is a version of first-order logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1, rather than simply True (1) or False (0).
Fuzzy systems can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems.
Bayesian networks are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems: reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), learning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm), planning (using decision networks) and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).
Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine a closest match.
They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI.
These examples are known as observations or patterns.
In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class.
A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made.
All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set.
Among recurrent networks, the most famous is the Hopfield net, a form of attractor network, which was first described by John Hopfield in 1982.
This procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested.
However, it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail.
Edward Fredkin argues that "artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler's "Darwin among the Machines" (1863), and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the same name in 1998.
The proposal was accepted in August 1942, when it was also decided that each month Palmach members would have eight training days, 14 work days and seven days off.
It is equal to 1,000 square meters.
Venezuela ( , ), officially called the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ( ), is a country on the northern coast of South America.
Venezuela is a federal presidential republic consisting of 23 states, the Capital District (covering Caracas), and federal dependencies (covering Venezuela's offshore islands).
Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America; the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north, especially in the capital, Caracas, which is also the largest city in Venezuela.
Since the discovery of oil in the early 20th century, Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves and has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil.
The 1980s oil glut led to an external debt crisis and a long-running economic crisis, in which inflation peaked at 100% in 1996 and poverty rates rose to 66% in 1995 as (by 1998) per capita GDP fell to the same level as 1963, down a third from its 1978 peak.
Chávez also remained in power after an all-out national strike that lasted from December 2002 to February 2003, including a strike/lockout in the state oil company PDVSA.
These devaluations have done little to improve the situation of the Venezuelan people who rely on imported products or locally produced products that depend on imported inputs while dollar-denominated oil sales account for the vast majority of Venezuela's exports.
Chávez survived several further political tests, including an August 2004 recall referendum.
He was elected for another term in December 2006 and re-elected for a third term in October 2012.
However, he was never sworn in for his third period, due to medical complications.
Chávez died on 5 March 2013 after a nearly two-year fight with cancer.
The presidential election that took place on Sunday, 14 April 2013, was the first since Chávez took office in 1999 in which his name did not appear on the ballot.
Nicolás Maduro has been the President of Venezuela since 14 April 2013, after winning the second presidential election after Chávez's death, with 50.61% of the votes against the opposition's candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski who had 49.12% of the votes.
Its cloud forests and lowland rainforests are particularly rich.
Venezuela hosts a total of 1,417 bird species, 48 of which are endemic.
Notable mammals include the giant anteater, jaguar, and the capybara, the world's largest rodent.
More than half of Venezuelan avian and mammalian species are found in the Amazonian forests south of the Orinoco.
For the fungi, an account was provided by R.W.G.
Dennis which has been digitized and the records made available on-line as part of the Cybertruffle Robigalia database.
That database includes nearly 3,900 species of fungi recorded from Venezuela, but is far from complete, and the true total number of fungal species already known from Venezuela is likely higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.
Among plants of Venezuela, over 25,000 species of orchids are found in the country's cloud forest and lowland rainforest ecosystems.
Venezuela is among the top 20 countries in terms of endemism.
The Central Range runs parallel to the coast and includes the hills surrounding Caracas; the Eastern Range, separated from the Central Range by the Gulf of Cariaco, covers all of Sucre and northern Monagas.
The Orinoco Delta, which forms a triangle covering Delta Amacuro, projects northeast into the Atlantic Ocean.
==Economy==The Central Bank of Venezuela is responsible for developing monetary policy for the Venezuelan bolívar which is used as currency.
The currency is primarily printed on paper and distributed throughout the country.
The President of the Central Bank of Venezuela is presently Eudomar Tovar, who also serves as the country's representative in the International Monetary Fund.
According to the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal, Venezuela has the weakest property rights in the world, scoring only 5.0 on a scale of 100; expropriation without compensation is not uncommon.
Venezuela has a Market-based mixed economy dominated by the petroleum sector, which accounts for roughly a third of GDP, around 80% of exports, and more than half of government revenues.
Venezuela has the least expensive petrol in the world because the consumer price of petrol is heavily subsidized.
More than 60% of Venezuela's international reserves is in gold, eight times more than the average for the region.
Most of Venezuela's gold held abroad is located in London.
On 25 November 2011, the first of US$11 billion of repatriated gold bullion arrived in Caracas; Chávez called the repatriation of gold a "sovereign" step that will help protect the country's foreign reserves from the turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.
However government policies quickly spent down this returned gold and in 2013 the government was forced to add the dollar reserves of state owned companies to those of the national bank in order to reassure the international bond market.
Manufacturing contributed 17% of GDP in 2006.
Agriculture in Venezuela accounts for approximately 3% of GDP, 10% of the labor force, and at least a quarter of Venezuela's land area.
The country is not self-sufficient in most areas of agriculture.
In 2012, total food consumption was over 26 million metric tonnes, a 94.8% increase from 2003.
Since the discovery of oil in the early 20th century, Venezuela has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil, and it is a founding member of OPEC.
The 1980s oil glut led to an external debt crisis and a long-running economic crisis, which saw inflation peak at 100% in 1996 and poverty rates rise to 66% in 1995 as (by 1998) per capita GDP fell to the same level as 1963, down a third from its 1978 peak.
The 1990s also saw Venezuela experience a major banking crisis in 1994.
The recovery of oil prices after 2001 boosted the Venezuelan economy and facilitated social spending.
In 2003 the government of Hugo Chávez implemented currency controls after capital flight led to a devaluation of the currency.
This led to the development of a parallel market of dollars in the subsequent years with the official exchange rate less than a sixth of black market value.
The fallout of the 2008 global financial crisis saw a renewed economic downturn.
With social programs such as the Bolivarian Missions, Venezuela made progress in social development in 2000s, particularly in areas such as health, education, and poverty.
Many of the social policies pursued by Chávez and his administration were jumpstarted by the Millennium Development Goals, eight goals that Venezuela and 188 other nations agreed to in September 2000.
===Petroleum and other resources===Venezuela has the largest oil reserves, and the eighth largest natural gas reserves in the world, and consistently ranks among the top ten world crude oil producers.
Compared to the preceding year another 40.4% in crude oil reserves were proven in 2010, allowing Venezuela to surpass Saudi Arabia as the country with the largest reserves of this type.
The country's main petroleum deposits are located around and beneath Lake Maracaibo, the Gulf of Venezuela (both in Zulia), and in the Orinoco River basin (eastern Venezuela), where the country's largest reserve is located.
Besides the largest conventional oil reserves and the second-largest natural gas reserves in the Western Hemisphere, Venezuela has non-conventional oil deposits (extra-heavy crude oil, bitumen and tar sands) approximately equal to the world's reserves of conventional oil.
The electricity sector in Venezuela is one of the few to rely primarily on hydropower, and includes the Guri Dam, one of the largest in the world.
In 1960, with a newly installed democratic government, Hydrocarbons Minister Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso led the creation of OPEC, the consortium of oil-producing countries aiming to support the price of oil.
Under Hugo Chávez a 2001 law placed limits on foreign investment.
As a result of the strike, around 40% of the company's workforce (around 18,000 workers) were dismissed for "dereliction of duty" during the strike.
Venezuela has a road network of nearly in length, placing the country around 45th in the world; around a third of roads are paved.
==Demographics==Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America; the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north, especially in the capital Caracas, which is also the largest city.
About 93% of the population lives in urban areas in northern Venezuela; 73% live less than from the coastline.
Though almost half of Venezuela's land area lies south of the Orinoco, only 5% of Venezuelans live there.
Practically half of the population claimed to be "moreno", a term used throughout Ibero-America that in this case means "dark-skinned" or "brown-skinned", as opposed to having a lighter skin (this term connotes skin color or tone, rather than facial features or descent).
Ethnic minorities in Venezuela consist of groups that descend mainly from African or indigenous peoples; 2.8% identified themselves as "black" and 0.7% as "afrodescendiente" (Afro-descendant), 2.6% claimed to belong to indigenous peoples, and 1.2% answered "other races".
Among indigenous people, 58% were Wayúu, 7% Warao, 5% Kariña, 4% Pemón, 3% Piaroa, 3% Jivi, 3% Añu, 3% Cumanágoto, 2% Yukpa, 2% Chaima and 1% Yanomami; the remaining 9% consisted of other indigenous nations.
According to an autosomal DNA genetic study conducted in 2008 by the University of Brasília (UNB), the composition of Venezuela's population is 60.60% of European contribution, 23% of indigenous contribution, and 16.30% of African contribution.
During the colonial period and until after the Second World War, many of the European immigrants to Venezuela came from the Canary Islands, which had a significant cultural impact on the cuisine and customs of Venezuela.
However, with the start of oil exploitation in the early 20th century, companies from the United States began establishing operations in Venezuela, bringing with them US citizens.
Later, during and after the war, new waves of immigrants from other parts of Europe, the Middle East, and China began; many were encouraged by government-established immigration programs.
Between 1900 and 1958 more than one million Europeans immigrated to Venezuela.
In addition, Venezuela also experienced immigration from other Latin American countries (especially Colombia) in the mid-to-late 19th century.
Between 500,000 and one million illegal immigrants are estimated to be living in the country.
The total indigenous population of the country is estimated at about 500 thousand people (2.8% of the total), distributed among 40 indigenous peoples.
Most indigenous peoples are concentrated in eight states along Venezuela's borders with Brazil, Guyana, and Colombia, and the majority groups are the Wayuu (west), the Warao (east), the Yanomami (south), and the Pemon (southeast).
===Religion===According to government estimates, 92% of the population is Roman Catholic, and the remaining 8% are either irreligious, Protestant, or a member of another religion.
In Venezuela, a population of Santería followers has been growing since 2008.
Spanish influences are evident in bullfights and certain features of gastronomy.
Venezuela was also enriched by other streams of Indian and European origin in the 19th century, especially from France.
In the latest stage in the major cities and regions oil of U.S. origin and manifestations of the new immigration of Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, increasing the already complex cultural mosaic.
For example, from United States comes the influence of taste for baseball, US-style fast food, and current architectural constructions.
Modernism took over in the 20th century.
===Music===Indigenous musical styles of Venezuela are exemplified by the groups Un Solo Pueblo and Serenata Guayanesa.
The national musical instrument is the cuatro.
The national dance is the "joropo".
In the last years, Classical Music has had great performances.
The Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra, under the baton of its principal conductor Gustavo Dudamel and José Antonio Abreu, has hosted a number of excellent presentations in many European concert halls, notably at the 2007 London Proms, and has received several honors.
===Sport===Baseball is Venezuela's most popular sport, with the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League existing since 1945.
Besides baseball, Venezuela's most popular sports are basketball and football.
Venezuela hosted the 2012 Basketball World Olympic Qualifying Tournament and the 2013 FIBA Basketball Americas Championship, which took place in Poliedro de Caracas.
(2007, 2047, 2087, 2127, 2167, 2207, 2247, 2287...)Venezuela is also home to Formula 1 driver, Pastor Maldonado.
At the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix, he claimed his first pole and victory and became the first and only Venezuelan to have done so in the history of Formula 1.
Among them are hallaca, pabellón criollo, arepas, pisca andina, tarkarí de chivo, jalea de mango, and fried camiguanas.
===Other===Venezuela is well known for its successes in beauty pageants.
Miss Venezuela is a big event in the country, and Venezuela has received 6 Miss World, 7 Miss Universe, 6 Miss International and 2 Miss Earth titles.
Venezuela ranks first in the Global Beauties webpage list as the country with more international pageants titles won.
It also has a Guinness World Record, after Dayana Mendoza, Miss Universe 2008 from Venezuela crowned Stefania Fernandez, also from Venezuela as Miss Universe 2009, marking the first time over 50 years in the competition that a country wins the title in two consecutive years.
Carlos Raúl Villanueva was the most important Venezuelan architect of the modern era; he designed the Central University of Venezuela, (a World Heritage Site) and its Aula Magna.
Net secondary enrollment rate was at 63% in 2005.
Venezuela has a number of universities, of which the most prestigious are the Central University of Venezuela (UCV), founded in Caracas in 1721, the University of Zulia (LUZ) founded in 1891, the University of the Andes (ULA), founded in Mérida State in 1810, and Simón Bolívar University (USB), founded in Miranda State in 1967.
==Health==Venezuela has a national universal health care system.
Infant mortality in Venezuela is 19.33 deaths per 1,000 births for 2014, lower than the South American average (by comparison, the U.S. stands at 5.9 deaths per 1,000 births in 2013).
Venezuela has a total of 150 plants for sewage treatment.
However, still 13% of the population lack access to drinking water, but this number has been dropping.

Modern measurements place this moment at approximately 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe.
The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were hydrogen, along with helium and traces of lithium.
Based on measurements of the expansion using Type Ia supernovae, measurements of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, and measurements of the correlation function of galaxies, the universe has an estimated age of 13.798 ± 0.037 billion years.
In the most common models the universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with an incredibly high energy density and huge temperatures and pressures and was very rapidly expanding and cooling.
This resulted in the predominance of matter over antimatter in the present universe.
The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons.
A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons.
As the universe cooled, the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon radiation.
After about 379,000 years the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded.
The details of this process depend on the amount and type of matter in the universe.
The best measurements available (from WMAP) show that the data is well-fit by a Lambda-CDM model in which dark matter is assumed to be cold (warm dark matter is ruled out by early reionization), and is estimated to make up about 23% of the matter/energy of the universe, while baryonic matter makes up about 4.6%.
In an "extended model" which includes hot dark matter in the form of neutrinos, then if the "physical baryon density" Ωbh2 is estimated at about 0.023 (this is different from the 'baryon density' Ωb expressed as a fraction of the total matter/energy density, which as noted above is about 0.046), and the corresponding cold dark matter density Ωch2 is about 0.11, the corresponding neutrino density Ωvh2 is estimated to be less than 0.0062.
The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form.
When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion.
These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but today there are efforts to test each of them.
For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the fine structure constant over much of the age of the universe is of order 10−5.
To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10−5 via observations of the CMB.
This defines a "future horizon", which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence.
The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the FLRW model that describes our universe.
After World War II, two distinct possibilities emerged.
In this model the universe is roughly the same at any point in time.
Much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form in the context of the Big Bang, understanding the physics of the universe at earlier and earlier times, and reconciling observations with the basic theory.
However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected.
Prior to this, the universe comprised a hot dense photon-baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly scattered from free charged particles.
In 1989 NASA launched the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE).
Its findings were consistent with predictions regarding the CMB, finding a residual temperature of 2.726 K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.725 K) and providing the first evidence for fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB, at a level of about one part in 105.
In early 2003 the first results of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) were released, yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters.
This value can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of CMB fluctuations.
The ratios predicted (by mass, not by number) are about 0.25 for /, about 10−3 for /, about 10−4 for / and about 10−9 for /.
This provides direct evidence that there was a period in the history of the universe before the formation of the first stars, when most ordinary matter existed in the form of clouds of neutral hydrogen.
On 17 March 2014, astronomers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced the apparent detection of primordial gravitational waves, which, if confirmed, may provide strong evidence for inflation and the Big Bang.
However, on 19 June 2014, lowered confidence in confirming the findings was reported; and on 19 September 2014, even more lowered confidence.
Dark energy, though speculative, solves numerous problems.
Since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the "missing" energy density.
Negative pressure is believed to be a property of vacuum energy, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang.
Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos.
This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic matter.
Computer simulations that matched the observations of the stellar populations of globular clusters suggested that they were about 15 billion years old, which conflicted with the 13.8 billion year age of the universe.
This issue was partially resolved in the late 1990s when new computer simulations, which included the effects of mass loss due to stellar winds, indicated a much younger age for globular clusters.
The problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat.
For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes(the time of nucleosynthesis), the universe density must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.
Pragmatism is a rejection of the idea that the function of thought is to describe, represent, or mirror reality.
Instead, pragmatists consider thought to be a product of the interaction between organism and environment.
Thus, the function of thought is as an instrument or tool for prediction, action, and problem solving.
However, the phrase is often confused with "pragmatism" in the context of politics (which refers to politics or diplomacy based primarily on practical considerations, rather than ideological notions) and with a non-technical use of "pragmatism" in ordinary contexts referring to dealing with matters inone's life realistically and in a way that is based on practical rather than abstract considerations.
Doubt, like belief, requires justification.
It arises from confrontation with some specific recalcitrant matter of fact (which Dewey called a 'situation'), which unsettles our belief in some specific proposition.
Note that anti-skepticism is a reaction to modern academic skepticism in the wake of Descartes.
William James wrote:In reality, James asserts, the theory is a great deal more subtle.
For example, to believe my cheating spouse is faithful may help me feel better now, but it is certainly not useful from a more long-term perspective because it doesn't accord with the facts (and is therefore not true).
Pragmatists who work in these fields share a common inspiration, but their work is diverse and there are no received views.
===Philosophy of science===In the philosophy of science, instrumentalism is the view that concepts and theories are merely useful instruments and progress in science cannot be couched in terms of concepts and theories somehow mirroring reality.
Instrumentalism does not state that truth doesn't matter, but rather provides a specific answer to the question of what truth and falsity mean and how they function in science.
Schiller sought to undermine the very possibility of formal logic, by showing that words only had meaning when used in context.
What he offers is something philosophers would recognize today as a logic covering the context of discovery and the hypothetico-deductive method.
===Metaphysics===James and Dewey were empirical thinkers in the most straightforward fashion: experience is the ultimate test and experience is what needs to be explained.
To the pragmatists, this went against the spirit of empiricism: we should try to explain all that is given in experience including connections and meaning, instead of explaining them away and positing sense data as the ultimate reality.
===Philosophy of mind===Both John Dewey in "Experience and Nature" (1929) and half a century later Richard Rorty in his monumental "Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature" (1979) argued that much of the debate about the relation of the mind to the body results from conceptual confusions.
===Ethics===Pragmatism sees no fundamental difference between practical and theoretical reason, nor any ontological difference between facts and values.
Both facts and values have cognitive content: knowledge is what we should believe; values are hypotheses about what is good in action.
*1975 – Papua New Guinea gains independence from Australia.
The center of the state is dominated by the Central Valley, a major agricultural area.
At least half of the fruit produced in the United States is now cultivated in California, and the state also leads in the production of vegetables.
Between 2000 and 2009, there was a natural increase of 3,090,016 (5,058,440 births minus 2,179,958 deaths).
During this time period, international migration produced a net increase of 1,816,633 people while domestic migration produced a net decrease of 1,509,708, resulting in a net in-migration of 306,925 people.
The state of California's own statistics show a population of 38,292,687 for January 1, 2009.
California is the second-most-populous sub-national entity in the Western Hemisphere and the Americas, with a population second to that of State of São Paulo, Brazil.
The center of population of California is located in the town of Buttonwillow, Kern County.
The state has the 5th largest population of African Americans in the U.S., an estimated 2,250,000 residents.
California's Native American population of 285,000 is the most of any state.
The official language of California has been English since the passage of Proposition 63 in 1986.
However, many state, city, and local government agencies still continue to print official public documents in numerous languages.
The five largest sectors of employment in California are trade, transportation, and utilities; government; professional and business services; education and health services; and leisure and hospitality.
In output, the five largest sectors are financial services, followed by trade, transportation, and utilities; education and health services; government; and manufacturing.
Agriculture is an important sector in California's economy.
This increase has occurred despite a 15 percent decline in acreage devoted to farming during the period, and water supply suffering from chronic instability.
Property tax increases are capped at 2% per year (see Proposition 13).
*1991 – Estonia, North Korea, South Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia join the United Nations.
Sexual orientation is an enduring pattern of romantic or sexual attraction (or a combination of these) to persons of the opposite sex or gender, the same sex or gender, or to both sexes or more than one gender.
* Residential density: The number of people living in an urban area / area of residential land.
The southern continent is called Aphrodite Terra, after the Greek goddess of love, and is the larger of the two highland regions at roughly the size of South America.
The only volcanic complex of this size on Earth is the Big Island of Hawaii.
This is not because Venus is more volcanically active than Earth, but because its crust is older.
On other cratered bodies, such as Earth and the Moon, craters show a range of states of degradation.
No craters are smaller than 3 km, because of the effects of the dense atmosphere on incoming objects.
Objects with less than a certain kinetic energy are slowed down so much by the atmosphere that they do not create an impact crater.
The atmospheric mass is 93 times that of Earth's atmosphere, whereas the pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times that at Earth's surface—a pressure equivalent to that at a depth of nearly 1 kilometre under Earth's oceans.
This makes the Venusian surface hotter than Mercury's, which has a minimum surface temperature of and maximum surface temperature of , even though Venus is nearly twice Mercury's distance from the Sun and thus receives only 25% of Mercury's solar irradiance.
From the year 1 to 5383, there are 526 approaches less than 40 million km; then there are none for about 60,158 years.
An alternative explanation for the lack of satellites is the effect of strong solar tides, which can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner terrestrial planets.
The transit of Venus was first observed in 1032 by the Persian astronomer Avicenna, who concluded Venus is closer to Earth than the Sun, and established Venus was, at least sometimes, below the Sun.
These three features are now the only ones on Venus that do not have female names.
Mariner 2 also obtained improved estimates of its mass and of the astronomical unit, but was unable to detect either a magnetic field or radiation belts.
Probably tilted onto its side, it returned a weak signal, supplying temperature data for 23 minutes, the first telemetry received from the surface of another planet.
In 1985, the Soviet Union took advantage of the opportunity to combine missions to Venus and Comet Halley, which passed through the inner Solar System that year.
The Fifth Crusade (1213–1221) was an attempt by Catholic Europeans to reacquire Jerusalem and the rest of the Holy Land by first conquering the powerful Ayyubid state in Egypt.
The null data type represents a variable that has no value; "NULL" is the only allowed value for this data type.
This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture.
Franz Boas (1858–1942) was trained in this tradition, and he brought it with him when he left Germany for the United States.
Nevertheless, they saw patterns of consumption and leisure as determined by relations of production, which led them to focus on class relations and the organization of production.
In the United States, "Cultural Studies" focuses largely on the study of popular culture, that is, on the social meanings of mass-produced consumer and leisure goods.
Richard Hoggart coined the term in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies or CCCS.
As the field developed it began to combine political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies and art history to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts.
These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture.
This emerges in the writings of early British cultural-studies scholars and their influences: see the work of (for example) Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Paul Willis, and Paul Gilroy.
The distinction between American and British strands, however, has faded.
Some researchers, especially in early British cultural studies, apply a Marxist model to the field.
Other approaches to cultural studies, such as feminist cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view.

Sometimes applications are bundled with the computer, but that does not change the fact that they run as independent applications.
Each instruction causes the computer to carry out an operation – moving data, carrying out a computation, or altering the control flow of instructions.
Data movement is typically from one place in memory to another.
Software can be tested through unit testing, regression testing and other methods, which are done manually, or most commonly, automatically, since the amount of code to be tested can be quite large.

Their copresence pushes protons slightly apart, reducing the electrostatic repulsion between the protons, and they exert the attractive nuclear force on each other and on protons.
* Mössbauer spectroscopy also relies on the nuclear transitions of specific isotopes, such as 57Fe.
It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean.
Asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems.
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the economies of the PRC and India have been growing rapidly, both with an average annual growth rate of more than 8%.
In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equaled that of the USA as the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 yen/US$.
Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Singapore.
Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.
Asia has four main financial centers: Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai.
For instance, according to Ethnologue, more than 600 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 800 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines.
China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.
He is also the writer of the national anthems of Bangladesh and India.
Also, Mother Teresa of India and Shirin Ebadi of Iran were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their significant and pioneering efforts for democracy and human rights, especially for the rights of women and children.
In 2006, Dr. Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for the establishment of Grameen Bank, a community development bank that lends money to poor people, especially women in Bangladesh.
On 22 June 2006, he became one of only four people ever to be recognized with Honorary Citizenship by the Governor General of Canada.
On 28 May 2005, he received the Christmas Humphreys Award from the Buddhist Society in the United Kingdom.

Helium is a chemical element with symbol He and atomic number 2.
He tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but failed because helium does not have a triple point temperature at which the solid, liquid, and gas phases are at equilibrium.
This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas.
Solid helium has a density of 0.214 ± 0.006 g/cm3 at 1.15 K and 66 atm; the projected density at 0 K and 25 bar (2.5 MPa) is 0.187 ± 0.009 g/cm3.
When helium II boils, due to its high thermal conductivity it does not bubble but rather evaporates directly from its surface.
Of the 2008 world helium total production of about 32 million kg (193 million standard cubic meters) helium per year, the largest use (about 22% of the total in 2008) is in cryogenic applications, most of which involves cooling the superconducting magnets in medical MRI scanners.
Europe, in particular ancient Greece, is the birthplace of Western culture.
It played a predominant role in global affairs from the 15th century onwards, especially after the beginning of colonialism.
Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European nations controlled at various times the Americas, most of Africa, Oceania, and the overwhelming majority of Asia.
Both world wars were largely focused upon Europe, greatly contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the United States and Soviet Union took prominence.
During the Cold War, Europe was divided along the Iron Curtain between NATO in the west and the Warsaw Pact in the east.
Stallman wanted computer users to be "free", as most were in the 1960s and 1970s – free to study the source code of the software they use, free to share the software with other people, free to modify the behavior of the software, and free to publish their modified versions of the software.
This philosophy was later published as the GNU Manifesto in March 1985.
In October 1985, Stallman set up the Free Software Foundation (FSF).
The most prominent and successful of these was Cygnus Solutions, now part of Red Hat.
This idea is often referred to as copyleft.

As of the 2.0.3 release, OpenOffice.org changed its release cycle from 18 months to releasing updates every three months.
Firewall technology emerged in the late 1980s when the Internet was a fairly new technology in terms of its global use and connectivity.
The term "packet filter" originated in the context of BSD operating systems.
Originally, the NAT function was developed to address the limited number of IPv4 routable addresses that could be used or assigned to companies or individuals as well as reduce both the amount and therefore cost of obtaining enough public addresses for every computer in an organization.
Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world's personal computer market with over 90% market share, overtaking Mac OS, which had been introduced in 1984.
Windows 1.0 is not a complete operating system; rather, it extends MS-DOS.
The shell of Windows 1.0 is a program known as the MS-DOS Executive.
Windows 2.0 also introduced more sophisticated keyboard shortcuts and could make use of expanded memory.
In addition to full Windows-packages, there were runtime-only versions that shipped with early Windows software from third parties and made it possible to run their Windows software on MS-DOS and without the full Windows feature set.
===Windows 3.0 and 3.1===Windows 3.0, released in 1990, improved the design, mostly because of virtual memory and loadable virtual device drivers (VxDs) that allow Windows to share arbitrary devices between multi-tasked DOS applications.
Windows 3.0 is the first Microsoft Windows version to achieve broad commercial success, selling 2 million copies in the first six months.
Windows 3.1, made generally available on March 1, 1992, featured a facelift.
Support for Windows 3.1 ended on December 31, 2001.
Mainstream support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2000 and extended support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2001.
In May 1999, Microsoft released Windows 98 Second Edition, an updated version of Windows 98.
Mainstream support for Windows 98 ended on June 30, 2002 and extended support for Windows 98 ended on July 11, 2006.
On February 17, 2000, Microsoft released Windows 2000, a successor to NT 4.0.
Mainstream support for Windows XP ended on April 14, 2009.
Extended support ended on April 8, 2014.
====Windows Vista and later====After a lengthy development process, Windows Vista was released on November 30, 2006 for volume licensing and January 30, 2007 for consumers.
It contained a number of new features, from a redesigned shell and user interface to significant technical changes, with a particular focus on security features.
Windows 8, the successor to Windows 7, was released generally on October 26, 2012.
On April 25, 2005, Microsoft released Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions to support the x86-64 (or simply x64), the eighth generation of x86 architecture.
x64 is still supported.
Windows CE was the core from which Windows Mobile was derived.
Its successor, Windows Phone 7, was based on components from both Windows CE 6.0 R3 and Windows CE 7.0.
Windows Phone 8 however, is based on the same NT-kernel as Windows 8.
In versions of Windows after and including Windows 2000 SP3 and Windows XP, updates can be automatically downloaded and installed if the user selects to do so.
Windows Vista changes this by introducing a privilege elevation system called User Account Control.
In this way, the new logon session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system.
User applications, including the Windows Shell, are then started with the restricted token, resulting in a reduced privilege environment even under an Administrator account.
However using this process of AGLP/AGDLP/AGUDLP allows a small number of static permissions to be applied and allows for easy changes to the account groups without reapplying the file permissions on the files and folders.
===Windows Defender===On January 6, 2005, Microsoft released a Beta version of Microsoft AntiSpyware, based upon the previously released Giant AntiSpyware.
===Third-party analysis===In an article based on a report by Symantec, internetnews.com has described Microsoft Windows as having the "fewest number of patches and the shortest average patch development time of the five operating systems it monitored in the last six months of 2006.
It has been in the development stage since 1996.
When Securify was acquired by Kroll-O'Gara, he became the president of its information security group.

Mauritania was part of the larger French colony of French West Africa and, as such, had no capital during the colonial period: Saint-Louis, in Senegal, held that position.
In 1958, Mauritania was formed as an autonomous republic in the French Community, and in 1960 it became an independent country, with Nouakchott as its capital.
Between 1988 and 1989, racial tensions between Arabs and blacks escalated.
Some estimates put the 2008 population at over 2 million; more conservative estimates put that number at 800,000, estimated to be close to one-third of the country's population.
In 2000, there were over 30 small or middle-size factories in the city.
==Education==The city is home to the University of Nouakchott, which is the only university in Mauritania and was opened in 1981.
Other higher education facilities include the National School of Administration and the National Institute of Advanced Islamic Studies.
One beach is devoted to fishing boats where fish can be bought fresh.
Once the hydrogen fuel at the core is exhausted, a star with at least 0.4 times the mass of the Sun expands to become a red giant, in some cases fusing heavier elements at the core or in shells around the core.
The star then evolves into a degenerate form, recycling a portion of its matter into the interstellar environment, where it will contribute to the formation of a new generation of stars with a higher proportion of heavy elements.
Meanwhile, the core becomes a stellar remnant: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or (if it is sufficiently massive) a black hole.
The oldest accurately dated star chart appeared in ancient Egyptian astronomy in 1534 BC.
The first star catalogue in Greek astronomy was created by Aristillus in approximately 300 BC, with the help of Timocharis.
Many of the constellations and star names in use today derive from Greek astronomy.
In 185 AD, they were the first to observe and write about a supernova, now known as the SN 185.
&lt;/ref&gt;Medieval Islamic astronomers gave Arabic names to many stars that are still used today, and they invented numerous astronomical instruments that could compute the positions of the stars.
By the following century, the idea of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers.
William Herschel was the first astronomer to attempt to determine the distribution of stars in the sky.
During the 1780s, he performed a series of gauges in 600 directions, and counted the stars observed along each line of sight.
From this he deduced that the number of stars steadily increased toward one side of the sky, in the direction of the Milky Way core.
His son John Herschel repeated this study in the southern hemisphere and found a corresponding increase in the same direction.
The first direct measurement of the distance to a star (61 Cygni at 11.4 light-years) was made in 1838 by Friedrich Bessel using the parallax technique.
Important theoretical work on the physical structure of stars occurred during the first decades of the twentieth century.
Successful models were developed to explain the interiors of stars and stellar evolution.
With the exception of supernovae, individual stars have primarily been observed in our Local Group of galaxies, and especially in the visible part of the Milky Way (as demonstrated by the detailed star catalogues available for ourgalaxy).
The only exception is a faint image of a large star cluster containing hundreds of thousands of stars located at a distance of one billion light years—ten times further than the most distant star cluster previously observed.
However, the IAU has disassociated itself from this commercial practice, and these names are neither recognized by the IAU nor used by them.
==Units of measurement==Although stellar parameters can be expressed in SI units or CGS units, it is often most convenient to express mass, luminosity, and radii in solar units, based on the characteristics of the Sun:Large lengths, such as the radius of a giant star or the semi-major axis of a binary star system, are often expressed in terms of the astronomical unit (AU)—approximately the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun (150 million km or 93 million miles).
The period of gravitational contraction lasts about 10 to 15 million years.
Such stars are said to be on the main sequence and are called dwarf stars.
Stars that begin with more than 50 can lose over half their total mass while on the main sequence.
The duration that a star spends on the main sequence depends primarily on the amount of fuel it has to fuse and the rate at which it fuses that fuel, i.e.
For the Sun, its life is estimated to be about 10 billion (1010) years.
Low mass stars consume their fuel very slowly.
Stars less massive than 0.25 , called red dwarfs, are able to fuse nearly all of their mass as fuel while stars of about 1 can only use about 10% of their mass as fuel.
The combination of their slow fuel-consumption and relatively large usable fuel supply allows about 0.25 stars to last for about one trillion (1012) years according to stellar-evolution calculations, while the least-massive hydrogen-fusing stars (0.08 ) will last for about 12 trillion years.
However, since the lifespan of such stars is greater than the current age of the universe (13.8 billion years), no stars under about 0.85 are expected to have moved off the main sequence.
In about 5 billion years, when the Sun enters this phase, it will expand to a maximum radius of roughly , 250 times its present size.
As a giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its current mass.
In a red giant of up to 2.25 , hydrogen fusion proceeds in a shell surrounding the core.
Eventually the core is compressed enough to start helium fusion, and the star now gradually shrinks in radius and its surface temperature increases.
If what remains after the outer atmosphere has been shed is less than 1.4 , it shrinks to a relatively tiny object about the size of Earth, known as a white dwarf.
In larger stars, fusion continues until the iron core has grown so large (more than 1.4 ) that it can no longer support its own mass.
In a neutron star the matter is in a state known as neutron-degenerate matter, with a more exotic form of degenerate matter, QCD matter, possibly present in the core.
Within a black hole the matter is in a state that is not currently understood.
This is particularly true for very massive O and B class stars, where 80% of the stars are believed to be part of multiple-star systems.
As 85% of all stars are red dwarfs, most stars in the Milky Way are likely single from birth.
A typical galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars, and there are more than 100 billion (1011) galaxies in the observable universe.
While it is often believed that stars only exist within galaxies, intergalactic stars have been discovered.
The nearest star to the Earth, apart from the Sun, is Proxima Centauri, which is 39.9 trillion kilometres, or 4.2 light-years away.
Travelling at the orbital speed of the Space Shuttle (8 kilometres per second—almost 30,000 kilometres per hour), it would take about 150,000 years to get there.
Distances like this are typical inside galactic discs, including in the vicinity of the solar system.
Stars can be much closer to each other in the centres of galaxies and in globular clusters, or much farther apart in galactic halos.
===Age===Most stars are between 1 billion and 10 billion years old.
Some stars may even be close to 13.8 billion years old—the observed age of the universe.
The oldest star yet discovered, HD 140283, nicknamed Methuselah star, is an estimated 14.46 ± 0.8 billion years old.
===Chemical composition===When stars form in the present Milky Way galaxy they are composed of about 71% hydrogen and 27% helium, as measured by mass, with a small fraction of heavier elements.
Typically the portion of heavy elements is measured in terms of the iron content of the stellar atmosphere, as iron is a common element and its absorption lines are relatively easy to measure.
The star with the lowest iron content ever measured is the dwarf HE1327-2326, with only 1/200,000th the iron content of the Sun.
===Diameter===Due to their great distance from the Earth, all stars except the Sun appear to the unaided eye as shining points in the night sky that twinkle because of the effect of the Earth's atmosphere.
The Sun is also a star, but it is close enough to the Earth to appear as a disk instead, and to provide daylight.
Other than the Sun, the star with the largest apparent size is R Doradus, with an angular diameter of only 0.057 arcseconds.
Betelgeuse, however, has a much lower density than the Sun.
Young, rapidly rotating stars tend to have high levels of surface activity because of their magnetic field.
A study of the Arches cluster suggests that is the upper limit for stars in the current era of the universe.
The reason for this limit is not precisely known, but it is partially due to the Eddington luminosity which defines the maximum amount of luminosity that can pass through the atmosphere of a star without ejecting the gases into space.
However, a star named R136a1 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, RMC 136a star cluster has been measured at 265 , which puts this limit into question.
A study determined that stars larger than 150 in R136 were created through the collision and merger of massive stars in close binary systems, providing a way to sidestep the 150 limit.
The first stars to form after the Big Bang may have been larger, up to 300 or more, due to the complete absence of elements heavier than lithium in their composition.
With a mass only 93 times that of Jupiter (), AB Doradus C, a companion to AB Doradus A, is the smallest known star undergoing nuclear fusion in its core.
Smaller bodies are called brown dwarfs, which occupy a poorly defined grey area between stars and gas giants.
This rate of rotation is just below the critical velocity of 300 km/s where the star would break apart.
By contrast, the Sun only rotates once every 25 – 35 days, with an equatorial velocity of 1.994 km/s.
A large portion of the star's angular momentum is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind.
In spite of this, the rate of rotation for a pulsar can be very rapid.
The pulsar at the heart of the Crab nebula, for example, rotates 30 times per second.
Surface patches with a lower temperature and luminosity than average are known as starspots.
Intrinsic or absolute magnitude is directly related to a star's luminosity and is what the apparent magnitude a star would be if the distance between the Earth and the star were 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years).
Both the apparent and absolute magnitude scales are logarithmic units: one whole number difference in magnitude is equal to a brightness variation of about 2.5 times (the 5th root of 100 or approximately 2.512).
This means that a first magnitude star (+1.00) is about 2.5 times brighter than a second magnitude (+2.00) star, and approximately 100 times brighter than a sixth magnitude star (+6.00).
The faintest stars visible to the naked eye under good seeing conditions are about magnitude +6.
This is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light-years from the Earth, while Canopus is much farther away at a distance of 310 light-years.
This star is at least 5,000,000 times more luminous than the Sun.
The least luminous stars that are currently known are located in the NGC 6397 cluster.
Most stars belong to the main sequence, which consists of ordinary hydrogen-burning stars.
This is followed by a numerical value that indicates the temperature index.
The explosion is created when the white dwarf accretes hydrogen from the companion star, building up mass until the hydrogen undergoes fusion.
Some novae are also recurrent, having periodic outbursts of moderate amplitude.
A notable example of an eclipsing binary is Algol, which regularly varies in magnitude from 2.3 to 3.5 over a period of 2.87 days.
The pressure gradient is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma; the outer part of the star is cooler than the core.
The occurrence of convection in the outer envelope of a main sequence star depends on the mass.
Red dwarf stars with less than 0.4 are convective throughout, which prevents the accumulation of a helium core.
For most stars the convective zones will also vary over time as the star ages and the constitution of the interior is modified.
Above the level of the photosphere is the stellar atmosphere.
In a main sequence star such as the Sun, the lowest level of the atmosphere is the thin chromosphere region, where spicules appear and stellar flares begin.
The existence of a corona appears to be dependent on a convective zone in the outer layers of the star.
The corona region of the Sun is normally only visible during a solar eclipse.
The net mass of the fused atomic nuclei is smaller than the sum of the constituents.
In the Sun, with a 10-million-kelvin core, hydrogen fuses to form helium in the proton-proton chain reaction::41H → 22H + 2e+ + 2νe (4.0 MeV + 1.0 MeV):21H + 22H → 23He + 2γ (5.5 MeV):23He → 4He + 21H (12.9 MeV)These reactions result in the overall reaction::41H → 4He + 2e+ + 2γ + 2νe (26.7 MeV)where e+ is a positron, γ is a gamma ray photon, νe is a neutrino, and H and He are isotopes of hydrogen and helium, respectively.
The energy released by this reaction is in millions of electron volts, which is actually only a tiny amount of energy.
Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol).
The discovery of this procedure henceforth led to commercial production of lithium, beginning in 1923, by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.
The United States became the prime producer of lithium in the period between the late 1950s and the mid-1980s.

==Who is a Jew?==Judaism shares some of the characteristics of a nation, an ethnicity, a religion, and a culture, making the definition of who is a Jew vary slightly depending on whether a religious or national approach to identity is used.
According to the 2007 estimates of The Jewish People Policy Planning Institute, the world's Jewish population is 13.2 million.
====Israel====Israel, the Jewish nation-state, is the only country in which Jews make up a majority of the citizens.
Israel was established as an independent democratic and Jewish state on May 14, 1948.
Of the 120 members in its parliament, the Knesset, currently, 12 members of the Knesset are Arab citizens of Israel, most representing Arab political parties.
One of Israel's Supreme Court judges is also an Arab citizen of Israel.
Between 1948 and 1958, the Jewish population rose from 800,000 to two million.
Currently, Jews account for 75.4% of the Israeli population, or 6 million people.
Israel also has a large population of Ethiopian Jews, many of whom were airlifted to Israel in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Between 1974 and 1979 nearly 227,258 immigrants arrived in Israel, about half being from the Soviet Union.
This period also saw an increase in immigration to Israel from Western Europe, Latin America, and North America.
Elsewhere in the Americas, there are also large Jewish populations in Canada (315,000), Argentina (180,000-300,000), and Brazil (196,000-600,000), and smaller populations in Mexico, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Colombia and several other countries (see History of the Jews in Latin America).
Demographers disagree on whether the United States has a larger Jewish population than Israel, with many maintaining that Israel surpassed the United States in Jewish population during the 2000s, while others maintain that the United States still has the largest Jewish population in the world.
Western Europe's largest Jewish community, and the third-largest Jewish community in the world, can be found in France, home to between 483,000 and 500,000 Jews, the majority of whom are immigrants or refugees from North African Arab countries such as Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia (or their descendants).
In Eastern Europe, there are anywhere from 350,000 to one million Jews living in the former Soviet Union, but exact figures are difficult to establish.
In Germany, the 102,000 Jews registered with the Jewish community are a slowly declining population, despite the immigration of tens of thousands of Jews from the former Soviet Union since the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Thousands of Israelis also live in Germany, either permanently or temporarily, for economic reasons.
Instead, a variety of secular and religious institutions at the local, national, and international levels lead various parts of the Jewish community on a variety of issues.

==Demographics==The population of the city was 40,000 in 1935 and 83,000 in 1949.
The city has experienced very high rates of population growth, from 150,000 inhabitants in the 1960s to over 5 million, according to the most recent sources.
==Sports==Football is the most popular sport in Riyadh.
There is also Al-Riyadh Club, which was established in 1954, as well as many other minor clubs.
The stadium hosted the FIFA Confederations Cup three times, in the years 1992, 1995 and 1997.

Said then joined the faculty of Columbia University in 1963, where he became professor of English and comparative literature in 1991.
It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world's most popular sport.
The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.
The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863.
The Cambridge Rules, first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football.
The world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup, which was founded by C. W. Alcock and has been contested by English teams since 1872.
FIFA, the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association.
The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.
Today, football is played at a professional level all over the world.
Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams, while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet.
A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level.
According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football.
The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990.
Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to be involved in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks.
For example, the 2005–06 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match.
==Laws==There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulation and guidelines.
The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game.
Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.
The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number.
From the beginning of each playing period with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee.
A second yellow card at the same game leads to a red card, and therefore to a dismissal.
There has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles.
Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) had the same status as the World Cup.
These are the European Championship (UEFA), the Copa América (CONMEBOL), African Cup of Nations (CAF), the Asian Cup (AFC), the CONCACAF Gold Cup (CONCACAF) and the OFC Nations Cup (OFC).
At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion.
In the first two-thirds of the 20th century, the Hamitic race was, in fact, considered one of the branches of the Caucasian race, along with the Indo-Europeans, Semites, and the Mediterranean race.
Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air.
This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites.

==Structure, growth and development==Most of the solid material in a plant is taken from the atmosphere.
Through a process known as photosynthesis, most plants use the energy in sunlight to convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, plus water, into simple sugars.
) These sugars are then used as building blocks and form the main structural component of the plant.
For the majority of plants to grow successfully they also require oxygen in the atmosphere and around their roots (soil gas) for respiration.
Biotic factors are also capable of affecting plant growth.
Plants compete with other plants for space, water, light and nutrients.
The growth rate of plants is extremely variable.
Some mosses grow less than 0.001 millimeters per hour (mm/h), while most trees grow 0.025-0.250 mm/h.
Some climbing species, such as kudzu, which do not need to produce thick supportive tissue, may grow up to 12.5 mm/h.
No human being can write fast enough, or long enough, or small enough† ( †"smaller and smaller without limit ...you'd be trying to write on molecules, on atoms, on electrons") to list all members of an enumerably infinite set by writing out their names, one after another, in some notation.
Such instructions are to be given quite explicitly, in a form in which "they could be followed by a computing machine", or by a "human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols.
== Formalization ==Algorithms are essential to the way computers process data.
So far, this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of imperative programming.
This is the most common conception, and it attempts to describe a task in discrete, "mechanical" means.
Unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the assignment operation, setting the value of a variable.
It derives from the intuition of "memory" as a scratchpad.
There is an example below of such an assignment.
Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms.
Pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural language statements.
Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer, but are often used as a way to define or document algorithms.
There is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given Turing machine program as a sequence of machine tables (see more at finite state machine, state transition table and control table), as flowcharts and drakon-charts (see more at state diagram), or as a form of rudimentary machine code or assembly code called "sets of quadruples" (see more at Turing machine).
Representations of algorithms can be classed into three accepted levels of Turing machine description:; 1 High-level description: "...prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details.
At this level we do not need to mention how the machine manages its tape or head.
"; 2 Implementation description: "...prose used to define the way the Turing machine uses its head and the way that it stores data on its tape.
At this level we do not give details of states or transition function.
"; 3 Formal description: Most detailed, "lowest level", gives the Turing machine's "state table".
For an example of the simple algorithm "Add m+n" described in all three levels, see Algorithm examples.
== Algorithmic analysis ==It is frequently important to know how much of a particular resource (such as time or storage) is theoretically required for a given algorithm.
Methods have been developed for the analysis of algorithms to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, the sorting algorithm above has a time requirement of O("n"), using the big O notation with "n" as the length of the list.
At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list.
Estimating the fair price for financial instruments using the Black–Scholes model is a complex algorithmic calculation.
The English word derives from the Latin "calculus", which originally meant a small stone in the gall-bladder (from Latin "calx").
It also meant a pebble used for calculating, or a small stone used as a counter in an abacus (Latin "abacus", Greek "abax").

Approximately 62% of the world's Muslims live in Asia, with over 683 million adherents in Indonesia, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh.
In the Middle East, non-Arab countries such as Turkey and Iran are the largest Muslim-majority countries; in Africa, Egypt and Nigeria have the most populous Muslim communities.
Most estimates indicate that the People's Republic of China has approximately 20 to 30 million Muslims (1.5% to 2% of the population).
Islam is the second largest religion after Christianity in many European countries,and is slowly catching up to that status in the Americas, with between 2,454,000, according to Pew Forum, and approximately 7 million Muslims, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), in the United States.
In late 1999, a group of dissatisfied officers staged a military coup, putting General Robert Guéï in power.
International organizations reported numerous human rights violations by both sides.
=== Ethnic groups ===Ethnic groups include Akan 42.1%, Voltaiques or Gur 17.6%, Northern Mandes 16.5%, Krous 11%, Southern Mandes 10%, other 2.8% (includes 30,000 Lebanese and 45,000 French; 2004).
77% of the population are considered Ivoirians.
Since Ivory Coast has established itself as one of the most successful West African nations, about 20% of the population (about 3.4 million) consists of workers from neighbouring Liberia, Burkina Faso and Guinea.
4% of the population is of non-African ancestry.
Many are French, Lebanese, Vietnamese and Spanish citizens, as well as Protestant missionaries from the United States and Canada.
===National government===As the capital of France, Paris is the seat of France's national government.
Government ministries are located in various parts of the city; many are located in the 7th arrondissement, near the Matignon.
While the Paris region's population accounted for 18.8 percent of metropolitan France in 2011, the Paris region's GDP accounted for 31 percent of metropolitan France's GDP.
As a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the "City of Art".
Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs.
Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royals commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the French Baroque and Classicism era.
Education in Paris and the Île-de-France region employs approximately 330,000 people, 170,000 of whom are teachers and professors teaching approximately 2.9 million children and students in around 9,000 primary, secondary, and higher education schools and institutions.
It comprises 300 stations (384 stops) connected by of rails, and 16 lines, identified by numbers from 1 to 14, with two minor lines, 3bis and 7bis.
She died in 1976 at the age of 68.
The Muhammad al-Durrah incident took place in the Gaza Strip on September 30, 2000, on the second day of the Second Intifada, amid widespread rioting throughout the Palestinian territories.
Three senior French journalists who saw the raw footage in 2004 said it was not clear from the footage alone that the boy had died, and that France 2 cut a final few seconds in which he appeared to lift his hand from his face.
Israeli writer Helen Schary Motro came to know him when she had employed him to help build her house.
She wrote in 2000 of his years of rising at 3:30 am to catch the bus to the border crossing at four, then a second bus out of Gaza so he could be at work by six.
The border was closed on the day of the incident because of the rioting, which is why Jamal was not at work.
His mother said he had been watching the rioting on television and asked if he could join in.
He began in journalism in 1971, and after studying film and television he started working for France 2 in 1981, becoming their bureau chief in Israel in 1990.
He is the author of several books about the Middle East, and is highly respected within the French establishment.
He ran his own press office, the National News Center in Gaza, and contributed to CNN through the Al-Wataneya Press Office.
He studied business administration in the U.S., and was a board member of the Palestinian Journalists' Association.
Daniel Seaman, director of the Israeli government press office, accused Abu Rahma on September 23, 2007 of the "systematic staging of action scenes," with reference to the al-Durrah footage, in a letter France 2 said was full of slander and half-truths.
I will never use journalism for anything ... because journalism is my religion.
Fallows writes that one camera caught a man being loaded into an ambulance, while footage from a different camera shows the same man jumping out of the ambulance a few minutes later.
According to Israeli spokesmen, the soldiers were under orders to fire only if they were fired at, and not in response to rocks or other objects being thrown at them.
The discrepancies have not been resolved; see below.
The shooting started again, and Jamal, Muhammad, and Oudeh, the Reuters cameraman, crouched against the concrete wall in the upper left/south east quadrant of the crossroads, diagonally across from the Israeli outpost.
He swore in an affidavit on October 3, 2000, that he had filmed 27 minutes of the incident which he said had lasted 45 minutes.
" Abu Rahma said shooting was also coming from the Palestinian National Security Forces outpost south of the junction, behind the spot where Jamal and Muhammad were crouching, but he said they were not shooting when Muhammad was hit.
An affidavit sworn by Abu Rahma on October 3, 2000, says the Israeli soldiers shot the boy in cold blood: "I can assert that shooting at the child Mohammed and his father Jamal came from the above-mentioned Israeli military outpost, as it was the only place from which shooting at the child and his father was possible.
===Israeli response===The position of the Israeli government and IDF changed over time, from accepting responsibility in October 2000 to retracting that admission in September 2007.
The day after the shooting, the IDF issued a statement saying it was impossible to determine the origin of the fire.
On October 3, the Israeli army's chief of operations, Major-General Giora Eiland, said the shots had apparently been fired by Israeli soldiers; the soldiers had been shooting from small slits in the wall, he said, and had not had a clear field of vision.
There is confusion about when the incident occurred, how much footage was shot, why it was blurred at the moment the shots were fired, why France 2 cut the final scene, and what time the boy arrived at the hospital.
There is no evidence that bullets were recovered, whether from the scene, from the bodies, or from Jamal.
The general told Schapira that he had no bullets, and that there had been no Palestinian investigation because there was no doubt as to who had shot the boy.
When told the general had no bullets, Abu Rahma said that France 2 had collected bullets at the scene.
He said: "We have some secrets for ourselves ... We cannot give anything ...
James Fallows wrote in "The Atlantic" in 2003 that Jamal and Muhammad first made an appearance in the footage at 3:00 pm (GMT+3), arguing that the time can be judged by later comments from Jamal and some journalists on the scene, and by the length of the shadows.
Brian Whitaker wrote in "The Guardian" in 2000 that the news first arrived in London from the Associated Press at 6:00 pm BST (GMT+1), followed minutes later by a similar report from Reuters.
A boy wrapped in a Palestinian flag, with his face exposed, who Fallows said looked like Muhammad, was carried through the streets of the refugee camp in front of thousands of mourners.
Several news organizations said this occurred on the evening of September 30.
Enderlin said that Shahaf wrote to him requesting a copy of the unedited footage, saying it was for "various professional audiences, including film schools," with the name of a company, Eye to Eye Communications, next to his signature.
They fired into the reconstructed concrete wall from different angles, and found that, to produce a round hole, they had to fire from more or less straight on.
It was shown to the head of Israeli military intelligence, and the key points were presented to the media in November 2000 as not ruling out that the IDF had shot the boy, though describing it as unlikely.
In February 2005, Shahaf presented his views to the American Academy of Forensic Sciences.
He said the evidence of the doctors was not consistent with photographs of the boy's body, suggesting that the dead boy in the photographs was not al-Durrah, that the body had reached the hospital before the incident was reported to have started, and that the signs of injury on the boy's body were not consistent with fresh blood.
Abu Rahma said that the gunfight lasted 45 minutes, and that he filmed about 27 minutes of it.
" Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the end, during which the boy appears to lift his hand away from his face, leading critics to say he was peeking at the camera.
The issue of how much footage exists was further confused in November 2007.
The court of appeal asked to see the footage, and in November 2007, France 2 presented the court with just 18 minutes of footage.
Enderlin then seemed to say there had never been 27 minutes of footage; according to "The Jerusalem Post", he said just before the screening, "I do not know where this 27 minutes comes from.
